# Working From Home

## 20.1 Purpose
Brosnan recognises that working from home (WFH) can support work-life balance, productivity, and business continuity. This policy sets clear expectations and eligibility for working from home on a regular or occasional basis.

## 20.2 Scope
This policy applies to all office-based employees. Site-based employees are generally not eligible due to the nature of construction work.

## 20.3 Eligibility
- Permanent full-time and part-time employees who have completed their 3-month probationary period  
- Employees whose role can be effectively performed remotely (determined by the manager)  
- Employees with a suitable, safe, and distraction-free home workspace  
- Employees who have demonstrated consistent performance and reliability

Casual employees and those on performance improvement plans are not normally eligible.

## 20.4 Types of Working from Home

| Type                  | Frequency                     | Approval Required                  |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Regular WFH           | Fixed day(s) per week         | Written agreement with manager     |
| Occasional/Ad-hoc WFH | As needed (e.g. appointments, illness recovery, bad weather) | Manager approval (usually same or previous day) |
| Full-time remote      | Rare – only in exceptional circumstances | CEO approval required              |

## 20.5 Application Process
1. Employee submits a short written request to their manager outlining:  
   - Proposed day(s)  
   - Reason  
   - Confirmation of suitable home setup  
2. Manager assesses suitability and impact on team/clients  
3. If approved, a simple WFH Agreement is signed and filed with HR

## 20.6 Employee Responsibilities When Working from Home

- Any work-related injury at home must be reported immediately

## 20.8 Costs and Equipment
- Internet and power costs remain the employee’s responsibility  
- Company mobile phone and laptop must be used  
- No additional allowance is paid for regular or occasional WFH
