# Safe Driving

## 23.1 Purpose
To ensure the safety of all employees, contractors, and the public by promoting responsible, defensive, and lawful driving practices whenever operating any vehicle on Company business (whether company-owned, leased, rented, or private).

## 23.2 Scope
This policy applies to every person who drives on behalf of Brosnan, including while using:
- Company vehicles
- Hired or rented vehicles
- Private vehicles for work purposes (including travel between sites or to/from work when on call)

## 23.3 Key Requirements

All drivers must:
- Hold a current, valid New Zealand driver licence appropriate for the vehicle being driven
- Immediately report to their manager any loss of licence, medical condition affecting driving, or serious traffic infringement
- Always wear a seatbelt and ensure all passengers do the same
- Never drive while impaired by alcohol, drugs (prescription or illegal), fatigue, or any substance that affects safe driving
- Obey all road rules, speed limits, and traffic signals at all times
- Not use a hand-held mobile phone or any hand-held device while driving (hands-free is permitted only when it does not distract)
- Plan journeys to allow adequate rest breaks and avoid driver fatigue
- Complete a daily pre-drive vehicle safety check (tyres, lights, brakes, fluids, wipers, load security)
- Secure all loads properly and within legal weight and dimension limits
- Never tow a trailer or load unless licensed and authorised to do so

## 23.4 Fatigue Management
- No driver is to exceed 13 hours total driving in any 24-hour period
- A minimum 30-minute break must be taken after 5.5 hours continuous driving
- Drivers feeling fatigued must stop in a safe place and rest or arrange alternative transport

## 23.5 Incident and Accident Reporting
- Any collision, near miss, traffic infringement, or vehicle damage must be reported to your manager immediately (within 1 hour where practicable)
- Complete an Incident Report form within 24 hours
- Do not admit liability at the scene

## 23.6 Consequences of Breach
Breaches of this policy (including speeding tickets, drink/drug driving, reckless driving, or repeated minor infringements) will be treated seriously and may result in:
- Immediate withdrawal of company vehicle privileges
- Requirement to use own vehicle without reimbursement
- Disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment
- Personal liability for fines, repair costs, or excess payments

## 23.7 High-Risk Driving
Any employee identified as a high-risk driver (through infringements, accidents, or complaints) will be required to undertake defensive driving training at their own cost and may have company vehicle use permanently withdrawn.

## 23.8 Journey Management
For long-distance or high-risk travel (e.g. night driving, poor weather, remote areas), a simple journey plan may be required and approved by your manager.

Safe driving is everyone’s responsibility – arrive alive.
