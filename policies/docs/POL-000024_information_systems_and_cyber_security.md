# Information Systems and Cyber Security

## 25.1 Purpose  
To protect Brosnan’s information assets, systems, and data from unauthorised access, misuse, damage, or loss, and to ensure all employees understand their responsibilities in maintaining a secure digital environment.

## 25.2 Scope  
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, consultants, and any third parties who access Brosnan’s information systems, networks, devices, email, cloud services, or data — whether on company premises, remotely, or via personal devices used for work purposes.

## 25.3 Key Principles  
- Information is a critical company asset and must be protected accordingly.  
- All users are responsible for cyber security — “See something, say something”.  
- Access is granted on a “need-to-know” and “least privilege” basis.  
- Breaches of this policy will be treated as serious misconduct.

## 25.4 Acceptable Use of Systems  
Company systems and devices are provided for business purposes. Reasonable personal use is permitted provided it:  
- Does not interfere with work duties  
- Does not consume excessive bandwidth or storage  
- Does not introduce security risks  
- Complies with all company policies (e.g. no illegal, offensive, or discriminatory content)

## 25.5 Prohibited Activities  
The following are strictly prohibited:  
- Sharing passwords or accounts  
- Installing unauthorised software or apps  
- Connecting unauthorised devices (USB drives, personal laptops, etc.) without IT approval  
- Accessing or attempting to access systems or data you are not authorised for  
- Disabling or bypassing security controls (antivirus, firewall, VPN, etc.)  
- Using company systems for personal commercial activities or secondary employment  
- Transmitting confidential information via unsecured channels (e.g. personal email, WhatsApp)  
- Clicking suspicious links or opening attachments from unknown sources

## 25.6 Passwords and Authentication  
- Passwords must be strong (minimum 12 characters, mix of letters, numbers, symbols)  
- Never write passwords down or share them  
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) must be enabled wherever available  
- Change default passwords immediately on new accounts or devices

## 25.7 Email and Communication Security  
- Treat all external emails with caution — verify sender before clicking links or attachments  
- Do not auto-forward company email to personal accounts  
- Mark external emails automatically (system in place)  
- Report suspicious emails to IT immediately (use the “Report Phishing” button)

## 25.8 Remote Access and Working from Home  
- VPN must be used for all remote access to company systems  
- Home Wi-Fi must be password-protected and encrypted  
- Devices must be locked when unattended  
- No work data to be stored on personal cloud drives (OneDrive personal, Google Drive, etc.)

## 25.9 Mobile Devices and Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)  
- Company devices must have the Mobile Device Management (MDM) profile installed  
- Personal devices used for work email/data must be enrolled in MDM or use only approved apps (Outlook, Teams)  
- Lost or stolen devices must be reported to IT within 1 hour for remote wipe if necessary

## 25.10 Data Protection and Confidentiality  
- Classify data appropriately (Public, Internal, Confidential, Restricted)  
- Confidential information must be encrypted when stored or transmitted  
- Do not discuss sensitive matters in public or over unsecured channels  
- Securely dispose of data (use secure delete or physical destruction for hard copies)

## 25.11 Incident Reporting  
Any suspected or actual security incident (phishing, malware, lost device, unauthorised access, data breach) must be reported to IT immediately — no matter how small.

## 25.12 Monitoring  
The Company monitors systems, networks, email, and internet usage to ensure compliance and security. Employees should have no expectation of privacy when using company systems.

## 25.13 Consequences of Breach  
Breaches may result in:  
- Immediate suspension of access  
- Disciplinary action up to and including termination  
- Personal liability for any loss or damage caused
