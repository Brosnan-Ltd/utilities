# Travel and Accommodation

## 28.1 Purpose  
To ensure all work-related travel and accommodation is safe, cost-effective, necessary, properly authorised, and complies with Brosnan’s duty of care and financial responsibilities.

## 28.2 Scope  
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and directors who travel or stay overnight for business purposes, whether domestic or international, and whether expenses are paid directly by the Company, via credit card, or reimbursed.

## 28.3 Pre-Approval Requirements  
All travel and accommodation (except local same-day travel) must be pre-approved in writing:  

| Trip Type                     | Minimum Approval Required          |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Domestic – same island        | Manager                            |
| Domestic – inter-island       | Director / CEO                     |
| International                 | CEO + one other Director           |
| Any trip > $5,000 total cost  | CEO + Board notification          |

Approval must consider: necessity, alternatives (e.g. Teams/Zoom), total cost, and safety.

## 28.4 Booking Process  
- All flights, rental cars, and accommodation must be booked through the Company’s preferred travel provider or directly by the office wherever possible to obtain corporate rates and duty-of-care tracking.  
- Private bookings (e.g. Airbnb, Booking.com) are discouraged and require prior manager approval.

| Incidentals (per night) | $25                                       |
