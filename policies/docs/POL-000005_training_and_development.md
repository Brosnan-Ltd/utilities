# Training and Development

## 6.1 Purpose and Scope
The Company is committed to providing career and training & development to assist Employees to meet their personal, academic and/or professional goals in ways that are consistent with the objectives of the organisation. The principal aims are to develop skills and knowledge, optimise their quality of work-life, and maximise their potential.

The overall responsibility for career planning rests with the individual.

## 6.2 Career Development
Employees are encouraged to take responsibility for their careers by identifying skills and knowledge that will assist them within their current roles and help them to anticipate future possibilities. Managers are expected to provide a supportive environment in which future goals, consistent with both individual and Company needs, can be identified and development plans established to help achieve them.

## 6.3 External Training Programmes and Conferences
In many situations, external courses and/or conference attendance may be identified as appropriate activities. Managers are responsible for the approval of Employees’ requests for training and the confirmation of available funding for such activities. However, final approval remains with the CEO or Chief Operating Officer, except for business as usual training such as SiteSafe, First-Aid, Safety at Height, etc.

Once the request has been approved, the Employee may apply for leave in line with the leave policy. Approval of the leave application is at the sole discretion of the relevant Manager.

## 6.4 Tertiary Studies
The Company encourages Employees to broaden their knowledge base by commencing or completing their diplomas or degrees. The organisation is not liable for any financial aid for Employees’ studies unless agreed in writing.

If an agreement is reached by both parties that the organisation will fund tertiary studies or a portion thereof, it is important to note that if the employee resigns or is dismissed in the succeeding 24 months of receiving the funding, the Employee will be responsible for refunding the organisation the full amount paid.

The Employee will not receive funding for subjects/papers that they have failed or for administration costs, such as books. The Employee may apply for study leave in line with the leave policy. Approval of the leave application is at the sole discretion of the relevant Manager.

## 6.5 On-the-Job Training or Coaching
On-the-job training or coaching occurs when a more experienced employee teaches a less experienced employee how to complete tasks.

## 6.6 Professional Membership and CPD
The Company encourages employees to maintain career-related professional memberships and will fund one professional membership annually at a reasonable cost. The membership expense needs to be approved by the Employee’s manager or budget owner before proceeding.

Employees are encouraged to maintain and complete Continuing Professional Development requirements related to professional membership.
