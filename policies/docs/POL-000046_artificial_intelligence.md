# Artificial Intelligence

## 47.1 Purpose and Scope

This policy outlines Brosnan’s approach to the development, implementation, and use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. It applies to all employees who interact with or develop AI systems on behalf of our organisation.

## 47.2 Principles

Brosnan is committed to the following principles in our AI practices:

1.  **Ethical Use**: We will ensure that AI systems are developed and used in ways that respect human rights, promote fairness, and avoid harm.
2.  **Transparency**: We will be open about how we use AI and provide clear explanations of AI-driven decisions when appropriate.
3.  **Accountability**: We will establish clear lines of responsibility for AI systems and their outcomes.
4.  **Privacy and Security**: We will protect individual privacy and maintain robust security measures for AI systems and data.
5.  **Human Oversight**: We will maintain meaningful human oversight of AI systems, especially for critical decisions.

## 47.3 Risk Assessment and Management

Brosnan will conduct regular risk assessments of AI systems, considering potential impacts on individuals, society, and our organisation.

We will implement appropriate safeguards and controls to mitigate identified risks.

## 47.4 Data Governance

We will ensure that data used for AI systems is collected, stored, and processed in compliance with New Zealand data protection laws and ethical standards.

We will strive for high data quality and implement measures to prevent bias in our datasets.

## 47.5 AI Development and Deployment

All AI systems will be developed with security and privacy considerations built in from the design phase. We will test AI systems thoroughly before deployment to ensure reliability, safety, and alignment with our ethical principles.

We will implement ongoing monitoring and evaluation processes for deployed AI systems.

## 47.6 Transparency and Explainability

We will strive to make our AI systems as transparent and explainable as possible, particularly when they affect individual rights or significant decisions.

We will provide clear information to stakeholders about how our AI systems work and make decisions.

## 47.7 Human Oversight and Decision-Making

Critical decisions will always involve meaningful human oversight and the ability to override AI recommendations when necessary.

We will clearly define the roles and responsibilities of humans in AI-supported decision-making processes.

## 47.8 Employee Training and Awareness

We will provide regular training to employees on AI ethics, risks, and best practices. We will foster a culture of responsible AI use throughout the organisation.

## 47.9 Third-Party and Vendor Management

We will ensure that third-party AI systems or components used by our organisation adhere to this policy.

We will conduct due diligence on AI vendors and include appropriate contractual safeguards.

## 47.10 Compliance and Auditing

We will regularly audit our AI systems and practices to ensure compliance with this policy and relevant New Zealand laws and regulations.

We will stay informed about evolving AI regulations and adjust our practices accordingly.

## 47.11 Incident Response

In the event of an AI-related issue, employees should report the incident to their manager or the IT department.

A detailed incident report will be created, and the issue will be addressed promptly.
