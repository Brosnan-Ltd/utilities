The Company endorses the spirit of the [NZ Government's Broader Outcomes Policy](https://www.procurement.govt.nz/broader-outcomes/) to support wider social, economic, cultural, and environmental outcomes, noting that the NZ Government has identified:

> _“…the inclusion of broader outcomes in government procurement will likely involve increases in the upfront costs to government contracts, but that these increased costs will be justified by the longer-term benefits of public value procurement.”_

This Broader Outcomes Policy is a sustainable balance between being pragmatic and aspirational and is non-discriminatory (Rule 3), as applied to the needs of its customers first, stakeholders, the communities we operate in, and the environment we share.

## 43.5 Rule 17 – Increasing Access for New Zealand Businesses

**Objective:**  
The NZ Government has identified that “some businesses can find it difficult to bid for Government procurement opportunities.

**Company Commitment:**  
The Company is committed to helping NZ Government Agencies “removing these barriers and improving the ability for all businesses to bid” by providing feedback on Government procurement to the procurement agency when invited.

## 43.6 Rule 18 – Construction Skills and Training

**Objective:**  
The NZ Government “is committed to using its procurement to find ways to partner more effectively with the construction sector to grow the skills of New Zealand’s construction workforce.”

- Providing new employees with a comprehensive onboarding programme specific to each role
- Providing in-house training resources and support through access to subject matter experts, relevant how-to guides and industry information, on-the-job instruction, ongoing coaching and mentoring, and cross-functional exposure specific to each role
- Financially supporting ongoing learning such as external trade training, tertiary studies, conferences, and continuous professional development
- Collating performance expectations into twice-yearly feedback meetings to compare the Employee’s identified key performance areas and the standard of work required for the actual work performed by the Employee
- Encouraging managers to provide timely feedback outside of the twice-yearly feedback meetings
- Supporting an employee’s career development by providing a distinct career pathway that aligns with the Company’s customer service offerings, e.g.:
    1.  Apprenticeships
    2.  Cadetships
    3.  Developmental pathways
- Asking our sub-contractors what they can do over the life of the contract to train new construction workers and develop the skills of existing ones and providing this information to the procurement agency.
