# Whistleblower and Disclosure

## 30.1 Purpose  
To encourage and protect employees who, in good faith, raise genuine concerns about serious wrongdoing within Brosnan, and to ensure those concerns are properly investigated and addressed without fear of retaliation.

## 30.2 What is Protected Disclosure (“Whistleblowing”)?  
A protected disclosure is information that an employee reasonably believes shows serious wrongdoing in or by the Company, and which they disclose in accordance with this policy.  
Serious wrongdoing includes:  
- An unlawful act  
- Serious risk to health, safety, or the environment  
- Gross mismanagement or waste of company funds  
- Corruption, bribery, or fraud  
- Serious breach of Brosnan policies or Code of Conduct  
- Oppression, abuse of authority, or gross negligence  
- Any action designed to conceal the above

## 30.3 Who is Protected?  
Any current or former employee, contractor, supplier, or volunteer who makes a protected disclosure in good faith is protected under the Protected Disclosures (Protection of Whistleblowers) Act 2022 – even if the concern later proves to be incorrect.

## 30.4 How to Make a Disclosure  
You can raise your concern with any of the following Protected Disclosure Officers:  
- Your direct manager (if you feel comfortable)  
- Any senior manager or Director  
- The CEO  
- The HR Manager  
- External: whistleblower@brosnan.co.nz (goes directly to the CEO and one independent Director)  

You may remain anonymous if you wish, but providing your name helps with investigation and follow-up.

## 30.5 Investigation Process  
- All disclosures will be treated seriously and confidentially  
- An appropriate person (independent of the issue) will be appointed to investigate  
- You will receive acknowledgement within 5 working days and updates on progress  
- Investigations will be fair, impartial, and completed as quickly as possible  
- You may be asked to provide further information

## 30.6 Protection from Retaliation  
Brosnan will not tolerate any retaliation, victimisation, or disadvantage against anyone who makes or assists with a good-faith disclosure. This includes:  
- Dismissal or forced resignation  
- Demotion or denial of promotion  
- Bullying, harassment, or discrimination  
- Damage to reputation  

Any retaliation is serious misconduct and may lead to disciplinary action, including dismissal.

## 30.7 False or Malicious Disclosures  
Making a deliberately false or malicious disclosure is serious misconduct and will result in disciplinary action.

## 30.8 External Reporting  
If you are not satisfied with the internal response, or believe it is not safe to report internally, you may report to an appropriate external authority such as:  
- WorkSafe New Zealand  
- Serious Fraud Office  
- Police  
- A Minister of the Crown  
Your protection still applies.

## 30.9 Confidentiality  
Information about the disclosure and your identity (if provided) will only be shared with those who need to know for the purposes of investigation and resolution.

## 30.10 Support  
Employees who make disclosures will be offered appropriate support, which may include counselling through the Employee Assistance Programme (EAP).

Your courage in speaking up helps protect Brosnan, our people, and our values.  
If in doubt – speak out.
