# Drug and Alcohol

- This policy is supplemented by the Disciplinary Policy.

## 10.1 Purpose and Scope

The Company has implemented this Drug and Alcohol Policy to minimise the risk of workplace and related accidents.  

The Company will conduct Employee drug and alcohol screening tests.

- Randomly
- At pre-employment and
- Where a reasonable cause or suspicion exists (including in relation to an incident, or where a detection dog identifies a substance on a person)

## 10.2 Use of Prescribed or Pharmaceutical Medications

Employees on medication, which is either prescribed or over the counter medication, are responsible for seeking advice from their doctor or pharmacist on whether any side effects from the medication could cause impairment or affect their work.

The Employee must immediately notify their Manager so that the Company can take any necessary steps to provide a safe workplace. The Company may seek a medical opinion on a prescribed or over the counter medications and their effect on an Employee’s capacity to perform their work safely.

### 10.2.1 Declaration of Medications

The Employee must declare their use of any prescription or over the counter medication before undertaking the drug and alcohol screening test.

If the laboratory test results are consistent with the prescription or over the counter medication the Employee declared at the time of the drug and alcohol screening test, the sample will be deemed ‘negative’.

Where prescription or over the counter medication impairs or affects an Employee’s ability to work safely, and the Employee is a site-based Employee, the Employee will not be permitted to return to a site-based position until they can produce a ‘negative’ test result or make another arrangement in consultation with their treating medical practitioner. It may be necessary to undertake an injury management process. The Employee may take available leave until such time.

## 10.3 Drug Testing

All aspects of the testing procedure will be carried out in a confidential and private manner. Drug and alcohol testing (screening and laboratory) will be conducted in accordance with AS/NZS 4308:2008: “Procedures for specimen collection and the detection and quantitation of drugs of abuse in urine.”

NZQA qualified (Unit Standards 25458 and 25511) collectors will collect specimens and forward any ‘non-negative’ specimens to the accredited laboratory for confirmation testing.

If this laboratory test results in a ‘positive’, disciplinary action may follow, including dismissal. If the result is ‘negative’ no further tests will follow.

## 10.4 Laboratory Testing

Following a ‘non-negative’ result, the Employee will need to complete a ‘Workplace Consent/Chain of Custody Form’. Refusal to complete this form will be deemed as serious misconduct.

An Employee can arrange to have independent testing done at the time of the Company testing. The tester will collect another sample and dispatch it to the Employee’s selected laboratory. The cost of the additional laboratory analysis will be at the Employee’s expense.

### 10.4.1 Laboratory confirmed

- If a ‘non-negative’ screening test (except for medications) is confirmed ‘positive’ by a laboratory the Employee will be stood down on normal pay (please refer to the disciplinary policy for more information on suspension).
- Employee will be advised, and disciplinary action may follow including termination of employment.

## 10.5 Refusal to Test, Intentionally Leaving Site or Falsification of Results

The Company will deem an Employee’s actions as serious misconduct if the Employee:

- Refuses to submit to a drug screening or lab test
- Does not cooperate fully with a drug screening or lab test
- Falsifies any alcohol and/or drug test or
- Intentionally leaves a site where testing is to be performed.

The Employee will be advised. Disciplinary action may follow including termination of employment.

## 10.6 Alcohol Testing

The test for alcohol will be carried out by using an approved Breath Testing Device.

If the Screening test results are less than 250 µg/L, or 100 µg/L for under 20 years of age breath alcohol concentration, the results are ‘negative’.

If the Screening test results are 250 µg/L or greater for over 20-year olds or 100 µg/L or greater for under 20-year olds, a second or confirmatory test must be conducted. If the secondary screening test (confirmatory test) results are 250 µg/L or greater for over 20-year olds or 100 µg/L or greater for under  20-year olds, the test will be deemed as serious misconduct.

### 10.6.1 Confirmatory Test

The confirmatory test must be conducted using the same Breath Testing Device as the Screening test. Before the confirmatory test may be given, a minimum of 15 minutes and maximum of 20 minutes must have passed since the screening test was performed. During this period, the Employee should remain under observation and avoid any actions that could increase mouth alcohol.

The 15-20 minute wait period is to ensure that the presence of mouth alcohol does not artificially raise the test result. If the results of the initial and confirmatory tests are not identical, the confirmation test result is deemed to be the final test result.

Only the confirmatory test results shall be reported, irrespective of the results of the Screening test. Disciplinary action may follow including termination of employment.

## 10.7 Arrangements for Employees on special leave

Employees will be placed on special leave on pay until the laboratory results are returned for:

- A ‘non-negative’ where the Employee is a site-based Employee or
- Failure to pass an alcohol test, pending results
- Annual leave may be taken, or leave without pay, if further time off is required

## 10.8 Follow-Up Testing

Upon return to work the Employee will be subject to up to six unannounced follow-up drug and/or alcohol tests over the next 12 months.

These tests may look for the presence of any amount of the drug (i.e. it is not restricted to cut-off levels). A second ‘positive test’ may result in disciplinary action including dismissal.
