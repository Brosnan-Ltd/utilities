# Complaints & Grievances

## 42.1 Purpose and Scope

From time to time, individual employees may have complaints or grievances about their work, their working conditions, or the people they work with. The Company encourages employees to raise their concerns with management so that problems can be resolved openly and fairly.

This policy sets out procedures which employees may use to raise any complaints or grievances and provides:

1.  Guidelines to resolve complaints or grievances quickly and informally in the first instance, and
2.  Providing a more formal procedure and review process, should this be required.

While the Company encourages employees to use this process, it does not replace or remove an employee’s access to the disputes and grievances procedures provided by the Employment Relations Act 2000.

Employees are reminded that, while raising or responding to a complaint or grievance, should confidentiality be broken or misappropriate behaviour occurs breaching the Code of Conduct or breaking Company rules, the [`Disciplinary Policy`](https://info.brosnan.co.nz/policies/docs/POL-000016_disciplinary.html) will apply. For example, conduct which could bring the Company or any Client of the Company into disrepute or which conduct is materially damaging to any businesses owned by the Company or Client.

## 42.2 Dealing with Complaints and Grievances

The Company aims to resolve employees' problems as quickly as possible, with the least possible disruption, and as closely as possible to the point where they arise.

As a first step, an employee should take up an informal complaint or grievance with their immediate line manager. If that is not possible or appropriate (for example, the complaint involves the manager), the employee should take the problem to the next higher manager. If the complaint involves the CEO, the employee can go to the Chairperson of the Board, and if it is about the Chairperson of the Board, the employee can go to any other Director. Please also refer to the [`Whistle Blower and Disclosure Policy`](https://info.brosnan.co.nz/policies/docs/POL-000029_whistleblower_and_disclosure.html).

In exceptional circumstances, the employee may take the issue to Human Resources as a “neutral” party, but the employee may be referred back to their manager or their manager’s manager.

In discussion, the employee and the manager should try to agree on the nature and cause of the problem – and the action to be taken to resolve it.

If a face-to-face approach is not appropriate, or the employee cannot reach agreement with the manager, or the action agreed on is not taken within the timeframe agreed or does not solve the problem, the employee may use the more formal procedure set out in the next section.

## 42.3 Making a Formal Written Complaint

An employee who does not wish to raise a complaint or grievance informally or cannot resolve the complaint or grievance in that way may make a formal written statement of the problem and pass it to their manager or their manager’s manager.

The written statement should set out the complaint or grievance in as much detail as possible. It should describe the situation or event that is of concern, outline what happened, what the employee saw, who was involved, who else was present, and what was said including dates and times where possible. Copies of any relevant documents should be attached.

The statement should also set out what the employee wants the manager or the Company to do to resolve the problem or grievance.

The written statement of the complaint or grievance is not “confidential” between the employee and the manager. Inquiries may need to be made, and others may need to be spoken to in order to resolve the problem — and the manager or Company cannot take action if the complaint is made “in confidence.” However, no inquiries will be made that are not reasonably relevant to the problem raised, and the complainant's identity will not be revealed unless that is also reasonably necessary for reasons of fair procedure and natural justice.

## 42.4 Manager’s Acknowledgement

The manager or manager’s manager will acknowledge the formal written statement and arrange a meeting to discuss the problem and possible solutions.

The meeting will aim to reach an agreement on the nature of the problem and what can be done to solve it.

The manager or manager’s manager will usually be accompanied by another person (for example, another manager or a representative of Human Resources) who will advise and assist the manager and make notes of the discussion. The employee will be given a copy of any notes on request.

The employee may also be accompanied at the meeting, if desired, by a work colleague or other support person. The employee is responsible for making any arrangements for a representative or support person to be present.

If an agreement is reached, a note of that agreement will be made and confirmed in writing to the employee within two working days for signing. That note should set out the agreed understanding of the situation or problem and what action is to be taken, by whom, and when.

If the employee and the manager cannot agree, the manager will make a decision on the complaint and grievance. That decision will be made and communicated to the employee within two weeks of the meeting where practicable. However, the manager will need time to consider what was said at the meeting and to make any further investigations and will provide an expected date if a decision is predicted to take longer than two weeks.

## 42.5 Review of Decision

The employee may request in writing a review of the manager’s decision on the complaint or grievance, within ten working days of receipt, in any of these circumstances:

1. The manager fails to respond to the formal written statement within five working days from receipt and fails to arrange a meeting to consider the complaint or grievance within a further ten working days of receipt.
2. The manager fails to ensure that the action agreed at the meeting is taken within the agreed time frame.
3. The employee is not satisfied with the decision the manager makes to resolve the complaint or grievance following the meeting, or
4. The employee is not satisfied that the complaint or grievance has been handled in accordance with this policy and procedure.

The review will be conducted by a person nominated by the Chief Executive. The proposed reviewer will not have been involved in the original process or decision-making, nor someone who could be biased based on their position. The reviewer can be internal to the company or external. The employee will be given an opportunity to comment on the proposed reviewer before an appointment is made.

The reviewer will determine how the review is to be conducted, what information the reviewer will consider, and who will be spoken to. In any meeting with the reviewer, however, the employee will be entitled to have a representative or support person present.

Subject to the Employee Relations Act, the company will consider the reviewer’s decision to be final.
