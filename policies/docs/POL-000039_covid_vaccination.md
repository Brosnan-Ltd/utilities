# Vaccination

## 40.1 Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to provide a framework for us to manage vaccine mandates from government agencies, industry, and clients, while also preserving the rights and privacy of our employees. This policy sets out the Company’s position on vaccines in the workplace.

## 40.2 Scope

This policy applies to:

- all permanent, part-time, fixed-term and casual employees,
- all contractors and contractor workers,
- Company directors, and
- any persons attending our sites or offices.

References to vaccines, vaccinations, etc., refer to any of the MedSafe approved vaccines.

## 40.3 Background

All employers in New Zealand are required under the _Health and Safety at Work Act 2015_, to take all reasonable and practicable steps to ensure the health and safety of workers and other people coming into the workplace to identify, and eliminate, or otherwise control, all risks including those related to transmissible diseases.

An infectious disease is a workplace hazard.

We must adapt and take the necessary steps to protect our workforce and projects due:

- to the nature of infectious diseases and their ability to create variants with different properties and risks, and
- to frequent changes from the government about how infectious diseases are managed.

Our Company has an obligation to meet the above requirements and is also required to meet the requirements of client sites, even if they differ from our requirements. The Company has undertaken a risk assessments to determine the Company’s requirements, where this is not affected by client requirements. This policy addresses both the Company’s requirements and client requirements.

We recognise that client requirement, government agency mandates, laws and industry standards will change, and as a result, this policy will need to change also. We also recognise while currently two doses of the COVID vaccine are generally required under vaccine mandates, this may change in the future with additional (booster) shots being required.

## 40.4 Our Own Sites Where There Is No Existing Vaccination Requirement, and Our Own Offices

As a result of the Company’s COVID risk assessments, we do not mandate vaccines for our sites where there is no legal, industry or client requirement to do so. We do not mandate vaccines for our offices. A risk assessment specific to certain tasks may determine a vaccination is necessary.

We encourage people to vaccinate. We will facilitate our employees vaccinate by allowing reasonable paid time away from work to receive two doses of vaccines (and further doses if applicable).

We expect employees to always follow our COVID health and safety requirements on construction sites and in offices. These may differ from site to site, and from office to office, depending upon the specific circumstances of that location.

## 40.5 Where a Client Requires a Vaccine for Those Attending Site, and This Is Required by Law

Where a client requires a vaccine for those attending site, and this is required by law, we will require our employees to advise us if they are vaccinated or not. An employee may choose not to answer.

Where an employee meets the legal and client vaccination requirements, they will continue to work on that site as normal.

Where an employee does not meet client vaccination requirements or does not wish to share their vaccination information, the employee will not be permitted to continue to work on that client site. In these circumstances, we will make every effort to re-deploy that employee to another construction site.

If the employee does not meet client vaccination requirements, and cannot work at an alternative site or location, the employee may be stood down without pay.

## 40.6 Where a Client Requires a Vaccine for Those Attending Site, and This Is Not Required by Law

Where a client requires a vaccine for those attending site, and this is not required by law, we will require our employees to advise us if they are vaccinated or not. An employee may choose not to answer.

Where an employee meets the client vaccination requirements, they will continue to work on that site as normal.

Where an employee does not meet client vaccination requirements or does not wish to share their vaccination information, the employee will not be permitted to continue to work on that client site. In these circumstances, we will make every effort to re-deploy that employee to another construction site.

If the employee does not meet client vaccination requirements, and cannot work at an alternative site or location, the employee may be stood down without pay.

## 40.7 Where a Client Does Not Require a Vaccine for Those Who Attend Site

Where a client does not require a vaccine for those attending site, we will not require our employees to advise us if they are vaccinated or not. This will be subject to any risk assessments conducted by Company that determine a vaccination is necessary to perform a specific task.

We encourage people to vaccinate. We will facilitate our employees to vaccinate by allowing reasonable paid time away from work to receive two doses of vaccines (and further doses if applicable).

## 40.8 Where a Third Party Requires a Vaccine

Where an employee is required to attend the premises of, or receive the services of, a third party as a part of their role, and that the third party requires the employee to have a vaccine, that employee is required to have a vaccine.

Where an employee does not meet third-party vaccination requirements or does not wish to share their vaccination information, the employee will not be permitted to attend the premises of, or receive the services of, that third party. In these circumstances, we will make every effort to find alternate arrangements for the employee.

In the first instance, we will attempt to make reasonable alternate arrangements with the third-party provider or use another third-party provider. We may also attempt to make other reasonable alternate arrangements. We will not contribute to the cost of alternate arrangements with the third-party provider, the use of another third-party provider, or other reasonable arrangements.

If there are no alternate arrangements with the third-party provider, or other suitable third-party providers, or no other reasonable arrangements can be made, the employee will be stood down without pay. The employee will be given notice of termination of employment with a four week notice period. We will continue to make reasonable efforts to make alternate arrangements during the notice period. If the employee is unable to work during the notice period, then the company will consult with the employee regarding the option of paying out the notice period with an earlier termination date.

## 40.9 Employees Who Cannot Vaccinate

Where employees have a particular physical or other need that a suitably qualified health practitioner (while examining the person) determines would make it inappropriate for the person to be vaccinated, and that examination is supported in writing by a medical practitioner, an exemption will usually be given by the client or other party seeking a person’s vaccination status. We ask employees to share the written exemption with us.

## 40.10 What Is ‘Every Effort to Re-deploy’?

If an employee is no longer able to continue working on a site where vaccinations are required and does not meet the requirements of that vaccine mandate, we will make every effort to redeploy that person to another construction site. In the first instance, we will attempt to redeploy that employee to another site in the same region. If there are no available sites for redeployment in the same region, for whatever reason, we will attempt to redeploy that employee to a site in another region with that employee’s consent.

We will not contribute to the cost of redeployment of an employee to another region if they do not meet vaccination requirements for the site or region they were assigned to/employed to.

Employees should be aware that at any given time, many of our clients may require or are considering mandated vaccinations. Therefore, if an employee does relocate to an alternative role or project that does not presently have a vaccination requirement, this may change in future.

If there are no other sites in another region for redeployment, or the employee cannot or does not want to move to another region, the employee may be stood down without pay. The employee will be given notice of termination of employment with a four week notice period. We will continue to make efforts to redeploy that employee during the notice period. If the employee is unable to work during the notice period, then the company will consult with the employee regarding the option of paying out the notice period with an earlier termination date.

## 40.11 Collecting Vaccination Information

We ask employees to keep us informed on the ongoing status of their vaccinations and provide their vaccination certificates or other records once they have been administered, in so far as this is relevant to their current role/duties.

Any employee who does not provide us with their vaccination certificates (for any reason) will be recorded and managed as if they have not been vaccinated.

We will maintain employee’s vaccine related information—a register of individuals—confidentially and securely. The register will include information about those who have been vaccinated, those who choose not to be vaccinated, and those who do not wish to disclose their vaccination status. The register will be kept confidential and secure. The register will only be used for the purposes outlined in this policy.

## 40.12 Where a Client Requests Employee Vaccination Information

All employees who receive vaccinations are requested to provide a copy of their vaccination certificates to our Human Resources team, in so far as this is relevant to their role.

Employees must consent to us sharing their vaccination status with a client if it is requested by the client.

When a client requests an employee’s vaccination information, we will take reasonable steps to ensure it is managed confidentially both by us and by the client. We will only share the specific information required to determine the vaccination status (partially vaccinated, fully vaccinated, non-vaccinated or chooses not to answer) with client organisations, or information required by law. This information will be shared only in so far as it is relevant to their current role.

If an employee chooses not to disclose their vaccination status to client organisations, they will need to inform us at the time we collect the information that they do not wish for us to disclose that information to any other third party.

We will not share the information with any other party without first informing those to whom the information belongs and have obtained their permission to share that information.

## 40.13 Employees Who Choose Not to Provide Their Vaccination Information

Any employee who does not provide us with their vaccination certificates or records (for any reason), in so far as it is relevant to their current role, will be recorded and managed as if they have not been vaccinated.

## 40.14 Employees Who Choose Not to Vaccinate

We encourage people to vaccinate. We also recognise that there may be employees who cannot, or choose not to, vaccinate.

In all cases, we expect employees to always follow our COVID health and safety requirements on construction sites and in offices.

## 40.15 Contractor Workers

Where required by government legislation (including orders) or client requirements, sub-contractor workers will be required to vaccinate or show evidence it would be inappropriate for the person to be vaccinated (supported in writing by a medical practitioner).

The subcontractor worker agrees to share this information with us to meet client and government requirements. The information will be treated confidentially and will be used for this purpose only.

We will only ask for vaccination statuses and personal information from subcontractors if necessary to satisfy legal or client requirements. Where this information is collected by us, we will treat it confidentially and store it securely. We will only share it in a manner that has been authorised by the persons to whom the information belongs.

References to sub-contractor workers also include visitors, suppliers, couriers, and other persons who attend site.
