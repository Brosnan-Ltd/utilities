# Relationships in the Workplace

## 19.1 Purpose
Brosnan recognises that employees may develop personal relationships in the workplace. This policy ensures that such relationships do not create conflicts of interest, perceptions of favouritism, or disrupt the work environment.

## 19.2 Scope
This policy applies to all employees (permanent, fixed-term and casual) and includes romantic, sexual, or close personal relationships.

## 19.3 Definition of a Relationship
A “relationship” under this policy means a romantic, intimate, or sexual relationship between two employees, or a close family relationship (e.g. spouse, partner, parent, child, sibling) where one reports to or influences the career or conditions of the other.

## 19.4 Requirements

All employees must:
- Disclose any relationship (current or new) that falls within this policy to their manager and HR as soon as it begins or becomes known
- Not allow the relationship to influence decisions affecting recruitment, promotion, performance reviews, pay, discipline, work allocation, or any other employment matter
- Maintain professional behaviour at all times in the workplace
- Avoid situations where one partner directly or indirectly supervises, manages, or has authority over the other

## 19.5 Management of Disclosed Relationships
Upon disclosure:
- HR and senior management will assess whether a real or perceived conflict of interest exists
- Where a conflict is identified, reasonable steps will be taken to remove it. This may include:
  - Reassignment of reporting lines
  - Transfer to another team, site, or location
  - Changes to duties or responsibilities
- The preferences of both employees will be considered where practicable, but the Company’s decision is final
- All discussions and outcomes will remain confidential

## 19.6 Failure to Disclose
Failure to disclose a relationship covered by this policy is considered a breach of the Code of Conduct and may result in disciplinary action.

## 19.7 Relationships with Contractors, Clients or Suppliers
Romantic or sexual relationships with individuals from client organisations, contractors, or suppliers must also be disclosed if they could create a real or perceived conflict of interest or affect Brosnan’s reputation.

## 19.8 Confidentiality
All disclosures will be treated confidentially. Information will only be shared with those who need to know in order to manage the situation appropriately.

## 19.9 No Retaliation
Employees who disclose relationships in good faith will not face adverse treatment or retaliation.

Any questions about this policy should be directed to your manager or HR in confidence.
