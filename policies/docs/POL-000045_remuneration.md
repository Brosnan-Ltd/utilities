## 46.1 Definition

Remuneration refers to the payment of base salary or wages for work performed, as detailed in an employee’s Individual Employment Agreement (IEA) and Job Description.

## 46.2 Purpose and Scope

This policy establishes principles and a framework for assessing and determining remuneration. It provides employees with information on how they will be remunerated and offers guidance for scenarios such as out-of-cycle reviews, remuneration decreases or inter-regional changes.

This policy is guided by the principles that our remuneration practice should:

- Align with our culture and strategy
- Support the attraction, retention and engagement of employees and potential employees
- Reflect market conditions and organisational context
- Comply with applicable legislation and regulations
- Ensure equity and flexibility

## 46.3 Key Components of Remuneration

### 46.3.1 Determination of Remuneration Type
Employees will be classified as either salaried or waged based on the nature of their role.

### 46.3.2 Wages
Based on an agreed hourly rate for the number of hours completed in performing their role. Wages are paid weekly on a Thursday, calculated on the previous week’s total hours worked.

### 46.3.3 Base Salary
Based upon an agreed annual rate of remuneration, received monthly (1/12th) for performing their role. Salaries are paid on the 18th of every month (or the working day before if it falls on a weekend or public holiday).

### 46.3.4 Determination of Remuneration
The Company is committed to fair and equitable remuneration and reward practices, considering internal and external relativity, the commercial environment, and the ability to achieve the Company’s business objectives as outlined in this policy.

### 46.3.5 Living Wage
The Company will not, as a principle, pay below the Living Wage. Exceptions, with CEO approval, may apply to Minimum Wage categories such as Starting-Out, or Training, if applicable.  
Minimum Wage rates are set by the government and reviewed each year. Please refer to Employment New Zealand for current rates. Living Wage rate is calculated and published by Living Wage NZ.

## 46.4 Internal Relativities

Internal relativities refer to the structured approach of ensuring that remuneration within our organisation is fair and equitable across all roles. This involves evaluating and aligning remuneration levels based on the complexity, scope, and impact of different positions. We use the following categories as a baseline to maintain consistency and fairness in remuneration, ensuring employees are compensated within the overall context of the organisation.

### Role Responsibilities and Complexity
Alignment with the complexity, scope, and responsibilities of each role. This involves evaluating:

- The level of decision-making required
- The problem-solving requirements
- The degree of accountability and autonomy

### Skills and Experience
Reflecting the knowledge, skills, experience, and qualifications of the employee including:

- Specialised skills relevant to the role
- Years of experience in the field
- Professional qualifications and certifications

### Performance and Contribution
Consideration of the individual's performance and contribution to the Company's success, including:

- Past achievements and demonstrated results
- Potential for future contributions
- Alignment with Company values and objectives

### Company Financial Health and Strategic Objectives
The Company's financial performance and strategic goals will influence remuneration decisions. This involves:

- Supporting sustainable growth
- Aligning with long-term business objectives

## 46.5 External Relativities

External relativities refer to the alignment of our remuneration practices with the external market to ensure remuneration levels are competitive and reflect current industry standards. This involves comparing or adjusting compensation based on external benchmarks and market trends to attract, retain, and motivate effectively, helping our organisation remain competitive in the job market.

### 46.5.1 Market Benchmarking
The Company seeks independent third-party benchmark survey data to determine if employees are receiving fair and competitive remuneration and benefits. Survey providers collect information confidentially from companies to provide statistically driven data on remuneration ranges as well as local, regional, and national trends in the employment market.

The following are key points which demonstrate credibility in a survey provider:

- A list of participants is provided.
- The effective date of the survey data is clear.
- The job descriptions are relevant to the positions being benchmarked.
- Survey methodology and data validation are clearly stated.
- The information is confidential, anonymous, and not attributable to a company or individual.
- The data is independently sourced, with no conflict of interest.

### 46.5.2 External Survey Providers
Currently the Company uses an external remuneration survey provider as its primary source of market benchmark information, offering detailed insights into remuneration trends and benchmarks specific to our industry. The Company may also reference other reputable survey providers to validate and cross-check data. External benchmarking is conducted annually to assess our competitiveness and to set remuneration ranges for each role.

### 46.5.3 Remuneration Ranges
Remuneration ranges represent the bands established for each role within the Company, based on external market data and internal comparisons. These ranges define the minimum, midpoint, and maximum levels for different positions.

As employees gain skills and experience, their remuneration can progress through the remuneration range for their role based on the benchmark data:

- An employee who is newly promoted, or has moved into a new function, is likely to be paid around the Lower Quartile (the 25th percentile at which 25% of the data is lower than this point)
- An employee who is gaining competency and needs little or no supervision in a role, is likely to be paid around the Median (the 50th percentile at which 50% of the data is higher and 50% of the data is lower than this point)
- An employee who is competent and experienced in the role, demonstrates added value, and may instruct, supervise, coach or train others, is likely to be paid around the Upper Quartile (the 75th percentile at which 25% of the data is higher than this point)

Remuneration ranges and midpoints are adjusted in line with market rates and considering the Company’s financial viability. The Company will regularly monitor the effectiveness of our compensation practices through formal annual reviews.

### 46.5.4 Job Sizing
The Company utilises a job evaluation methodology as another part of determining remuneration. Using a points-based methodology, it gives weighting to education, experience and the strength of problem-solving skills demanded by roles. Other factors include complexity, scope, freedom to act, people management and level of authority.

### 46.5.5 Competitor Watch
The Company actively monitors competitors through job vacancy advertising, social posts, and independently verified information.

## 46.6 Employee Benefits

Employee Benefits are additional forms of compensation and support provided by the Company which go beyond base salary or wages. These benefits are designed to enhance employees' overall job satisfaction, support their well-being, and contribute to their financial security.

By offering a diverse range of benefits, the Company aims to recognise and reward employees for their contributions, while also providing resources which contribute to their health, safety, and personal development.

Employees should refer to their Individual Employment Agreement or the Leave Policy, Training and Development Policy and the Health Insurance and Employee Assistance Programme Policy for further information on specific benefits.

### 46.6.1 KiwiSaver
Employees are eligible to participate in the KiwiSaver scheme, a voluntary retirement savings programme. Employees can choose to contribute between 3% and 10% of their gross earnings to their KiwiSaver account, in line with the applicable legislation.

In addition to employee contributions, the Company provides a matching Employer contribution of 3% of the employee’s gross earnings. This contribution is paid directly into the employee’s KiwiSaver account and is supplementary to their base salary or wages. Participation in KiwiSaver helps employees build their retirement savings over time.

### 46.6.2 Benefit Review and Updates
The Company periodically reviews and updates its benefit offerings to ensure they remain competitive and relevant. Any changes to the benefits package will be communicated to employees promptly.

The Company reserves the right to amend or remove any of the benefits from time to time at its sole discretion.

## 46.7 Remuneration Reviews

All remuneration reviews take into consideration an individual’s performance and development, internal relativities, and external market data.

### 46.7.1 Eligibility
To be eligible for a remuneration review, Employees must meet the following conditions:

1.  Have not joined the Company, or moved into a new role, within three months of the remuneration review.
2.  Have not given notice of their intention to resign.
3.  Are not on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP).
4.  Are not, and have not been, subject to a disciplinary process during the previous six months.

### 46.7.2 Effective Dates
Changes for salaried staff will generally be effective from the 1st of the following month, whilst changes for waged staff will generally be effective from the Monday of the following remuneration period.  
All changes are confirmed in writing, supplementing the remuneration detailed in the employees’ Individual Employment Agreement (IEA).

### 46.7.3 Annual Remuneration Review Cycle
The Company undertakes an annual remuneration review for all employees. The Company, however, is not under any obligation to offer the Employee an increase in wages or salary following such a review and changes in an employee’s wage or salary are at the Company’s sole discretion.

### 46.7.4 Reduced hours (less than full-time equivalent)
Where an employee is working less than full-time hours of 40 hours per week, for example, 32 hours per week, the full-time equivalent (FTE) will be used in remuneration reviews to ensure the correct relative salary is being reviewed, then adjusted for the reduced hours.

Example (1): An employee earns £90,000 per annum for a full-time role, 40 hours per week. The Company approves a change request to 32 hours per week. The new annual remuneration will be calculated as follows – £90,000 divided by 52 weeks, divided by 40 hours = £43.27 per hour, multiplied by 32 hours, multiplied by 52 weeks = £72,000. Or, 32 hours per week is 0.8 of the FTE 40 hours per week, therefore the salary will be £90,000 x 0.8 = £72,000.

Example (2): An employee is earning £35.00 per hour and works 24 hours per week. The employee moves to full-time hours, i.e., 40 hours per week. The annual salary is calculated at £35 per hour x 40 hours per week x 52 weeks per year = £72,800.

### 46.7.5 Out of Cycle Remuneration Reviews
An employee’s remuneration may be reviewed at other times during the year should circumstances warrant a review, for example:

- with a move to a different role within the Company,
- a permanent move to a different location,
- a promotion, or,
- progression in the development of new skills, the attainment of professional qualifications or as part of a career developmental pathway.

## 46.8 Scenarios

The following guidance outlines common scenarios where remuneration is evaluated. These examples are not exhaustive and are adaptable based on individual circumstances with internal and external relativities serving as the foundation for any adjustments.

### 46.8.1 New Employee
New employees will be offered remuneration that is appropriate for the role, at a level that both attracts the employee to the Company and is at a level that is appropriate within the existing team. Hiring Managers should refer to the Delegated Authority Policy, and Recruitment, regarding approval and authority levels.

### 46.8.2 Lateral Move

### 46.8.2.1 Lateral move within region
Employees may be successful in their application for a lateral move, that is, another role at a similar level which is not considered a promotion. In these instances, the remuneration will be determined according to the external market information, along with internal relativities for that specific role.

### 46.8.2.2 Lateral move changing regions
A lateral move may also be the same role in a different location, for example, an inter-regional move such as a Site Manager in Auckland moves to a Site Manager role in Wellington. In this instance, it is possible that the local remuneration rates are lower in the destination location that the location they are moving from and may result in a remuneration decrease.

### 46.8.3 Promotion or Demotion
When an employee is successful in attaining a more senior level role, or promotion, the remuneration for the role will be in line with internal and external relativities. Managers will need to refer to the Delegated Authority Policy, Section 12 – Salary Adjustments, for approval.

In the instance an employee may wish to move to a smaller or more junior role, the remuneration for this role will be commiserate with internal and external relativities.

## 46.8.4 Change in Employment Type

### 46.8.4.1 Move between Full-Time and Part-Time
When employees propose a change in hours, for example full-time to part-time, or part-time to full-time, and this is agreed to by the Company, the remuneration will be determined on a pro rata basis.

Example (1): An employee earns £90,000 per annum for a full-time role, 40 hours per week. The Company approves a change request to 32 hours per week. The new annual remuneration will be calculated as follows – £90,000 divided by 52 weeks, divided by 40 hours = £43.27 per hour, multiplied by 32 hours, multiplied by 52 weeks = £72,000. Or, 32 hours per week is 0.8 of the FTE 40 hours per week, therefore the salary will be £90,000 x 0.8 = £72,000.

Example (2): An employee is earning £35.00 per hour and works 24 hours per week. The employee moves to full-time hours, i.e., 40 hours per week. The annual salary is calculated at £35 per hour x 40 hours per week x 52 weeks per year = £72,800.

### 46.8.4.2 Move between Salary and Wages
When an employee is moving from an hourly wage role, paid weekly, to an annual salaried role, paid monthly, the effective date of the change will be at the end of the weekly wage payroll cycle (the Payroll team will advise the changeover date to be used). The new salary and effective date will be outlined in the job offer and new IEA.

If an employee is moving from an annual salary to an hourly wage, the employee will move to a weekly payroll cycle. The minimum number of hours to be worked per week will be outlined in the individual’s employment agreement. The hourly rate will be calculated as follows: annual salary divided by 52 weeks, divided by 40 hours per week = hourly rate.
