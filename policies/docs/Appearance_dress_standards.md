# APPEARANCE & DRESS STANDARDS POLICY

## 3.1 Purpose and Scope

The purpose of this policy is to establish standards for employee appearance and dress to promote a professional image, ensure safety, and reflect the Company's values of taking ownership and building relationships. This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and visitors while on Company premises or representing the Company.

All employees are expected to maintain a clean, neat, and professional appearance appropriate to their role and work environment. Appearance should not distract from the professional conduct of business or pose a safety risk.

## 3.2 General Standards

- **Cleanliness and Grooming**: Employees must maintain personal hygiene, clean clothing, and well-groomed hair, nails, and facial hair. Strong perfumes or colognes should be avoided in shared spaces.
- **Clothing Condition**: Clothing must be free from rips, stains, or excessive wear.
- **Jewelry and Accessories**: Limit jewelry to avoid safety hazards, especially on sites (e.g., no dangling earrings or loose chains).

## 3.3 Dress Code by Work Environment

### Office Environment
- **Business Casual**: 
  - Men: Collared shirts, slacks or chinos, closed-toe shoes.
  - Women: Blouses, skirts (knee-length or longer), slacks, or dresses; closed-toe shoes.
- **Casual Fridays**: Jeans (dark wash, no rips) with business tops permitted.
- Avoid: T-shirts with logos, shorts, athletic wear, flip-flops, or overly casual items.

### Site/Construction Environment

- **Company Branded Gear**: Where provided, wear Company-branded high-vis vests or shirts.
- **Weather-Appropriate**: Layering for weather conditions, but always compliant with safety standards.
- Avoid: Loose clothing that could catch on equipment, open-toe shoes, or non-safety rated items.

## 3.4 Special Considerations

- **Cultural/Religious Attire**: Accommodations will be made for religious or cultural dress requirements, provided they do not compromise safety.
- **Temporary Adjustments**: For client meetings or events, dress may be elevated to formal business attire upon manager instruction.
- **Visitors and Contractors**: Must adhere to the same standards; non-compliant individuals may be denied access to sites.

## 3.5 Compliance and Breaches

Non-compliance may result in verbal counseling, written warnings, or disciplinary action per the Disciplinary Policy. Managers are responsible for enforcing this policy and providing guidance.

For questions, consult your manager. This policy aligns with our Purpose of making a positive difference by presenting a professional and safe image.
