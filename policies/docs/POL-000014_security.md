# Security

## 15.1 Purpose and Scope
This security policy is to ensure that the standard of recruitment throughout the Company is consistent.

The Company has implemented this security policy to minimise the risk of engaging an Employee on any client site, who has previous convictions involving theft, dishonesty, or violence and who poses a potential risk to our client, and our business reputation.

The security policy applies to all Employees.

## 15.2 Procedure
The following security documentation is required to be completed by all prospective employees:

- A self-declaration confirms that the candidate applying for a position with the Company has no criminal convictions or if they are currently appearing before the court on any matter.

The Company has determined that where a candidate has been convicted of multiple offences of all/or any involving theft, dishonesty, cultivation or possession of illegal substances for supply or violence within the last seven years, their employment application may be declined.

If the applicant has minor convictions pre-dating seven years, then those convictions will be considered by the Manager and a determination made as to the candidate’s suitability for employment with the Company.

If the candidate has been convicted of any serious offence in the past, irrespective of when the offence occurred, the application must first be discussed with the Manager (or CEO where appropriate) before the appointment is made.
