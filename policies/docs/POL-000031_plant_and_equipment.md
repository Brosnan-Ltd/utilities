# Plant & Equipment

## 32.1 Purpose  
To ensure all plant, machinery, and equipment (collectively “plant”) owned, hired, or used by Brosnan is operated safely, maintained in good condition, and used only by authorised and competent persons.

## 32.2 Scope  
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and subcontractors who operate, maintain, or work near any plant or equipment on Brosnan sites or premises. This includes (but is not limited to) excavators, cranes, elevated work platforms (EWPs), forklifts, scissorlifts, telehandlers, generators, compressors, and portable power tools.

## 32.3 Operator Requirements

- Have completed Brosnan’s site-specific induction and plant familiarisation  
- Have been formally authorised in writing by their supervisor or the Plant Coordinator  
- Are wearing the correct PPE for the task  

Evidence of licences/certificates must be verified and recorded before first use.

## 32.4 Pre-Start Checks and Maintenance  
Every operator must complete a daily pre-start inspection using the approved checklist (paper or app).  
Any defects or faults must be reported immediately and the item tagged “Out of Service” until repaired.  
Scheduled servicing and maintenance is arranged by the Plant Coordinator or site foreman – operators must present plant when due.

## 32.5 Safe Operating Rules  
All operators must:  
- Only operate plant they are authorised and competent to use  
- Never leave plant running unattended  
- Lower all blades, buckets, and booms when not in use  
- Use spotters when visibility is restricted  
- Keep clear of swing radii and crush zones  
- Never carry passengers unless the plant has an approved passenger seat  
- Comply with all site traffic management plans  
- Stop immediately if unsafe conditions arise

## 32.6 Hiring of Plant  
- All hired plant must come with current registration, maintenance records, and operator manuals  
- Hired plant must be inspected on delivery and before first use  
- Hire agreements remain the responsibility of the site manager or Plant Coordinator

## 32.7 Modifications and Attachments  
No modifications, alterations, or non-standard attachments may be made to any plant without written approval from the Plant Coordinator and, where required, the manufacturer.

## 32.8 Incident Reporting  
Any incident involving plant (collision, near miss, rollover, damage, or injury) must be reported immediately to the site supervisor and an Incident Report completed within 24 hours.

## 32.9 Consequences of Breach  
Unauthorised or unsafe operation of plant will be treated as serious misconduct and may result in:  
- Immediate removal from operating duties  
- Disciplinary action up to and including termination  
- Personal liability for damage or repair costs

## 32.10 Plant Register and Audits  
A central register of all owned and long-term hired plant is maintained by the Plant Coordinator. Regular audits and safety inspections will be conducted.

Safety is non-negotiable – if in doubt, stop and ask.
