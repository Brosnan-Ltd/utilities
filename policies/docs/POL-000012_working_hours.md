# Working Hours

The Working Hours Policy has been developed to ensure the health, safety and wellbeing of all staff, by establishing limits on the maximum working hours for all staff within the Group.

The Group policy for maximum working hours, for any employee, on any given day is 14 hours, including meal breaks. The total hours to be worked by any employee, in any given week should not exceed 70 hours. All staff must have a minimum of one full 24-hour rest day in each 7-day period. All staff must have at least 10 hours rest between shifts.

While in rare circumstances, there may be a requirement for staff to work in excess of these hours, management must take all practicable steps (where it is known) to plan, monitor and manage excessive hours where they may be likely to occur on a regular basis and where they could impact on the health and safety of the individual.

Where an employee is planning to work in excess of these hours, they must inform their line manager.
