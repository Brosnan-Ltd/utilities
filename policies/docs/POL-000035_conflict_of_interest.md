# Conflict of Interest

## 36.1 Purpose and Scope

To ensure that Employees making decisions on behalf of the Company disclose and manage any **conflict of interest** they may have, and act in a manner consistent with their responsibilities to the Company.

Company Employees have diverse interests and contacts across communities, and relationships between Employees and outside bodies are in the interest of the Company.

It is possible, however, that an Employee’s interests may at times give rise to an actual, potential, or perceived conflict of interest with their role and responsibilities.

Ensuring that conflicts of interest are properly managed is crucial to reducing legal and reputational risk and demonstrating the integrity of Employees and the Company. Conflicts of interest that are not properly managed have the potential to damage the reputation of Employees and the Company.

## 36.2 Guiding Principles

The guiding principles for the identification and management of conflicts of interest in any situation are:

- Employees acting on behalf of the Company must always be seen to behave in an impartial and transparent manner.
- The existence of a conflict of interest does not necessarily imply wrongdoing on the part of any person. However, any interests which could give rise to a conflict of interest must be disclosed.
- Managers need to be alert to situations in which they, or the people that they manage or supervise, may have a conflict of interest, and ensure that the situation is recognised and handled appropriately.
- Conflicts of interest must be dealt with quickly and transparently, that is they must be:
    - Acknowledged
    - Disclosed
    - Put on record, where appropriate
    - Effectively managed or avoided.
- If an Employee has any doubt as to whether a conflict of interest exists, they must disclose the matter to their Manager.
- Employees must consider how an impartial observer might reasonably perceive a conflict-of-interest situation or relationship, whether or not any wrongdoing is involved.
- Conflicts of interest may raise complex issues and Employees, and their Managers must judge each situation that arises in a prudent manner.
- Disclosure of conflicts of interest may involve disclosing personal information. This information must be handled with due regard to the privacy of the individual concerned.
- If a person has a conflict of interest in the matter being considered, they must not take part in any discussion or decision on the matter giving rise to the conflict unless the manager above decides otherwise.

## 36.3 Identification and Effective Management of Conflicts of Interest

- Employees must identify and disclose any actual or potential conflict of interest that may affect, or may be seen to affect, their impartiality when acting on behalf of the Company.
- Each conflict-of-interest situation must be dealt with as soon as reasonably practicable after it is identified.
- The situation must then be reviewed, managed, and recorded by the Manager.
- Managers must help to build awareness of conflict-of-interest situations, and support those who report to them to comply with their obligations under this policy.

## 36.4 Register of Interests

All conflicts of interest and relevant Manager responses are to be submitted for inclusion in the relevant conflicts of interest register, to be found in the SharePoint for Management only.

By submitting a conflict of interest to the relevant Manager, the Employee agrees the conflict may be disclosed to Management.

## FAQ’s

### How do I recognise a conflict of interest?

Simply put, you will have a conflict of interest if your duties and responsibilities to the Company could be affected or be perceived to be affected by some other interest or duty that you may have.

If your other interest or duties could lead you to make a different decision or take a different course of action, then, you have a conflict of interest.

### What if I know that I won’t let my interests get in the way of my duty to The Company?

Perception is very important. An Employee may conscientiously avoid letting their external interests influence their role at the Company, but even so, you should ask:

- Could a reasonable observer in the circumstances still consider that your decision or action could be biased or affected by some other interest you might have?

Employees have to be fully aware of the reputational damage that potential conflict could cause to themselves or the Company.

It is far better to be open and proactive in managing a potential conflict of interest than to have to deal later with any accusation of bias or covering up something.

### Who is responsible for identifying and disclosing a conflict of interest?**
The individual employee is responsible for identifying and disclosing a conflict of interest as soon as they become aware of it.

### What if the issue is complex and it’s not obvious whether any action needs to be taken, or what that action should be?

Many situations are not clear-cut. This requires employees to assess the seriousness of the issues and use discretionary judgement relating to a particular situation. Seeking advice from your manager is usually a good first step.

## Case Study

**Case 1**: I work at the Company, and I am also a friend/shareholder/close relationship of a small company that our company is seeking to purchase equipment from. Can I take part in the normal decision-making process for the selection to use this Company?

**Response:** This situation presents a clear conflict between your roles in each organisation as you have a direct financial interest in the outcome of this selection process. Where your duties to the Company could oblige you to select a competitive supplier, your personal interest with the company may reasonably be interpreted as pushing you towards favouring that company or potentially giving it an advantage over others.

Being completely open allows your manager to ensure that any decision is unbiased and reduces the risk of any bias or perception of bias in the decision itself.

The first step to take is to disclose your interest to your manager.

You should then take no part in the discussion concerning the Company. It may be that your knowledge could be useful to the Company in making a decision, and in such case, your manager may approve you being asked to provide input concerning this matter but only so that you can provide specific information. You should not be involved in making the decision.
