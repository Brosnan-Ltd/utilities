# Internal Controls

## 39.1 Purpose and Scope

The overall objective of the Internal Control Policy is to ensure adequate and effective internal controls are in place to manage risk, and these controls are applied consistently throughout the Group. They apply to all Staff (permanent, part-time and contractors), Management, and the Board.

Based on the information and explanations given by Management and Staff, the Board can then provide an opinion that the financial records may be relied on for preparing the financial statements and in maintaining accountability for the Group's assets and liabilities.

## 39.2 Guiding Principles

The Board of Directors is ultimately accountable for the management of risk. Management and Staff enable the Board to meet these responsibilities through a Risk Approach and then by implementing an Internal Control system.

Internal Controls help ensure that the Group resources are used efficiently and effectively. Risks should be continually assessed, and controls put in place which ensures that the risks are minimised.

Internal Controls will not eliminate all risks – to do so would create inefficiency – but the controls should reduce the risk to an acceptable level.

## 39.3 Approach to Risk

The Group’s approach to risk management defines risk as the threat or possibility that an action or event will adversely affect its ability to achieve its goals. To achieve this the Group will:

- Provide risk context – the theme of a group of risks as well as whether it is strategic or operational/commercial.
- Identify individual risk through analysis and assessment – the identification of what, why, the frequency and how events may arise, the determination of existing controls, and an analysis of risks in terms of the likelihood and impact of risk in the context of those controls.
- Form risk controls or treatments – for high and very high impact risks, the Group will develop and implement specific risk management plans, lower impact risks may be accepted and monitored.
- Continually communicate and maintain a risk register with regular review by the management and ultimately the Board.

## 39.4 System of Controls

The system of internal control must include:

### 39.4.1 Adequate Segregation of Duties

The ability to adequately segregate duties depends on the staffing levels and circumstances of each area. However, as a guide the following should apply:

- Monitoring and reporting of Budget to Actual.
- Separation of financial functions such as accounts payable or accounts receivable and the ability to amend bank accounts.
- Separation of the authorisation of transactions from the custody of the related assets.
- Separation of operating duties from financial record-keeping.

### 39.4.2 Onboarding and Supervision of Personnel and Definition of Responsibilities

- Recruitment and background reference checks which may include Ministry of Justice, police, drug, health, and safety history.
- Personnel are supervised in a manner that befits the task and skill level of the Personnel at hand.
- Personnel are given clearly defined lines of responsibility and authority – see the Delegated Authority Policy and roles and responsibilities matrix.

### 39.4.3 Existence of Adequate Policy, Documentation and Records

The existence and compliance with the policies and procedures for the procurement of goods and services and the payment of accounts are essential, such as:

- Delegated Authorities
- Fraud and Theft Policy
- Giving and Receiving of Gifts Policy
- Conflicts of Interest Policy
- Business Continuity Plan (BCP)
- Management or the Board may require an Internal Audit to review adherence to these policies and compliance with overarching laws and regulations.

### 39.4.4 Access

- Data is held securely with access controls such as passwords.
- Physical assets are locked and secured away.
