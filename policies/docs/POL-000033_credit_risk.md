# Credit Risk Policy

## 34.1	Purpose and Scope

To govern credit risk for the Company and protect against any unwarranted customer or counterparty credit exposures; maintain credit risk at a manageable level; and identify and avoid a material credit failure (of a significant value), the Company procedure for managing credit risk must be followed.

> **PROCEDURES**: SharePoint/Library/Procedures

The procedures outline acceptable steps for avoiding, mitigating, and effectively managing credit exposure. They also contain guiding principles to provide a framework for decision-making consistent with the company’s overall risk management objectives.
