# Receiving & Giving of Gifts

## 37.1 Purpose and Scope

This policy on the giving and receiving of gifts sets the standards for dealing with gifts within the Company. The policy is intended to protect employees by reducing the risk of perceived influence that may be associated with accepting or giving gifts, therefore assisting them to comply with their ethical obligations.

## 37.2 Guiding Principles

A gift or a benefit is defined as items given and received in the course of official duties and includes tangible (of lasting value) and intangible (of no lasting value) items. Gifts and benefits include, but are not limited to: Gifts of alcohol, clothes, and products; Gifts of travel or accommodation; Free use of facilities, tickets to the theatre, cultural events and sporting and other events; Restaurant meals and beverages; cash or cash equivalents such as vouchers or gift cards.

37.2.1
: Employees must not solicit any gift of significant value (i.e., over $100) from any person or organisation.

37.2.2
: The receipt of unsolicited gifts must not result in preferential treatment being given to a person or organisation in any way.

37.2.3
: Employees must avoid any situation that could directly or indirectly compromise or influence the performance of their duties.

## 37.3 Procurement

37.3.1
: Employees performing procurement and tendering functions must not accept gifts over the value of $100 while engaged in these functions unless it takes the form of an invitation to attend a supplier or industry conference, seminar, or trade show, where the hospitality element is incidental to the event and relevant business information is expected to be gained through their attendance.

37.3.2
: Employees having significant advisory input into procurement and tendering decisions where they have provided or are likely to provide advice must not accept gifts over $100.00 while engaged in these functions, unless it is principally to discuss business matters such as lunch or dinner, or at a conference or trade show.

37.3.3
: Gifts over $100 must not be accepted during, or immediately before or after, a related procurement or tendering exercise is being undertaken.

Where an Employee attends a conference and presents a paper or chairs a session, and is being offered free accommodation, this will not be regarded as a gift for this policy. Where an Employee is given an all-expenses (or substantially) paid attendance at a conference but has no significant role in the conference, this would be considered a gift.

## 37.4 Approval of Gifts

Gifts and benefits, both giving and receiving, must be approved before being sent or accepted as follows:

- Gifts or benefits received up to $100 may be accepted without prior approval.
- Gifts received with a value over $100 but less than $500 must have written approval from the relevant Regional or COO, or in the case of a COO being the recipient, the CEO. In the case of a CEO being the recipient, approval from the Chair.
- Gifts given with a value between $0 and $500 must have written approval from COO, or in the case of a COO being the recipient, the CEO. In the case of a CEO being the recipient, approval from the Chair.
- Gifts given or received of $500 or more must have written approval from the COO or in the case of a COO being the provider/recipient, the CEO. In the case of a CEO being the provider/recipient, approval from the Chair.

## 37.5 Approvals for Acceptance of Gifts

The following guidelines apply to approval for the acceptance of gifts:

- Written approval by email
- Where an Employee has any doubts about the appropriateness of accepting a gift, they must discuss it with their manager

## 37.6 Considerations to be Used by Approvers

The monetary value of the gift is not the only factor in deciding whether to accept or give it. Approvers must also consider the following:

- The reasons for the gift being given and whether there may be an explicit or implicit expectation of a favour in return.
- Whether there is any likely intention to develop an obligation by the person or organisation giving the gift.
- The value or importance the member would place on the gift and whether they are likely to be influenced by receiving it.
- Whether the value of the gift is both appropriate and reasonable for the circumstances in which it is being given.
- The frequency of the gift or benefit. Even a small gift or benefit given repeatedly may be inappropriate.
- Whether the receipt of the gift is likely to receive adverse publicity, or the intention could be misconstrued.

## 37.7 Gifts Register

A central Gifts Register is maintained on the SharePoint under Management for gifts valued at over $500.00. A nominated administrator will update the register for all approvals advised to them. To facilitate this, all approval emails are to be forwarded to the administrator within one week of the approval. The Register will contain:

- Particulars (including the gift type and donor name) and estimated value of the gift
- Date of receipt for the gift
- Identity of the person or body receiving the gift

The Gifts Register will be reviewed from time to time by the GM Finance to identify any trends, patterns or risks that may cause concern and need corrective or preventative action.
