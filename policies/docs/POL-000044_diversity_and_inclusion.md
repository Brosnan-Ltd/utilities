# Diversity & Inclusion

## 45.1 Purpose and Scope

The purpose of the policy is to outline our commitment to building and growing a diverse and inclusive workforce. It underpins our Code of Conduct to “Demonstrate courtesy and respect for colleagues and customers, including respect for cultural diversity.” It also supports our ability to comply with our obligations under New Zealand legislation.

### Definitions

**Diversity** – Refers to all the characteristics that make individuals different from each other. They include attributes or characteristics such as religion, race, ethnicity, language, gender, sexual orientation, disability, and age, as well as the different ideas, backgrounds, and opinions people bring.

**Inclusion** – Refers to practices and behaviours in the workplace that actively encourage inclusion within all workplace activities. It involves both the action of including people in opportunities and the outcomes of individuals feeling a sense of belonging and uniqueness. It represents the extent to which employees are or feel valued, respected, and encouraged to participate fully.
