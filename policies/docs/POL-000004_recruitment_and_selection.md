# Recruitment and Selection

## 5.1 Purpose and Scope
The purpose of this policy is to ensure fairness and effectiveness of the recruitment and unbiased selection process within the Company for all Employees and to ensure compliance with the Employment Relations Act 2000 and the Human Rights Act 1993.

Key roles in the recruitment process include the (1) Hiring Manager and (2) Recruiter (any member of the Recruitment team).

## 5.2 Advertising
Once a position has been identified and approval has been provided by the appropriate Manager, the role will be advertised by the Recruiter. The advertising period will be determined by the Recruiter in discussion with the Hiring Manager based on the urgency of the role.

## 5.3 Shortlisting & Assessments
The Recruiter will complete a preliminary shortlist in consultation with the Hiring Manager. Preliminary short-listing sorts all the applications per their suitability in line with the job description for the specific role. The preliminary shortlist will complete a Prevue Assessment. A final shortlist will be determined by the Hiring Manager for interviews. All unsuccessful candidates who do not meet the competencies for the position are sent a declined email.

## 5.4 Interviewing
The interview panel will consist of the Hiring Manager and possibly one to two others. It is recommended that a panel consists of no more than three panel members. At least one member of the panel should possess the expertise relevant to the position to assist with job-related questions and confirm the applicant’s actual level of skill and experience in the required field and assist in an unbiased candidate selection.

Interview questions will be prepared in advance by the Recruiter and/or the Hiring Manager. The same set of questions should be used for a specific role for all the short-listed candidates in the interviews to ensure consistency.

The panel will decide on the most suitable candidate for the role based on their skills, knowledge, and attributes relevant to the role. All unsuccessful candidates who interview must be phoned once a hiring appointment has been made.

To reduce potential biases in the selection process, the company will utilise the following steps: 
1. job descriptions and job advertisements are reviewed for possible bias, and 
2. the recruitment consultant will provide a short-list of suitably qualified candidates for the hiring manager, 
3. there will be more than one interviewer, i.e., the hiring manager and at least one other, using the same question set, 
4. utilise objective online assessments against pre-determined criteria for different roles, and 
5. meet satisfactory reference checks.

## 5.5 Reference Checking
Reference checking is completed online through Prevue when a candidate is selected for hire. At least two references provided must be from Managers that the candidate has reported to. The reference checking must confirm the assumptions that the Company has made about the candidate. Where possible, the hiring manager will also complete a verbal reference check, and the documented results will be stored in the recruitment applicant tracking system.

## 5.6 Employment Agreements
When a hiring decision has been made, the Hiring Manager must complete a Contract Request Form with the relevant details. A minimum of two weeks must be allowed between the receipt of the Contract Request Form by the HR team and the new employee’s Start Date. All contracts (Individual Employment Agreements IEA) must include a job description. A new employee cannot commence employment if the signed IEA has not been received by the company.

## 5.7 Drug and Alcohol Testing
Drug and alcohol testing will be completed for all Employees, where possible, within one week of the Company receiving a signed agreement, or at the very least within the first week if the appointment cannot be made prior to start. Migrant candidates are required to complete the drug and alcohol testing once they are in New Zealand and as soon as an appointment can be made.

## 5.8 Employment of Migrants
Where the Company employs Migrant Workers, they must provide a valid work visa, evidence of permanent resident status, an Australian or New Zealand passport, New Zealand birth certificate or a certificate of New Zealand citizenship following the acceptance of a verbal offer.

Employing a Migrant Worker without a valid Work Permit or Permanent Residency is in contradiction to the Immigration Act 2009 and any Amendments. If the Employee’s work visa expires during his/her employment, the organisation is legally obliged to stand that employee down, until the visa is renewed.

No Company Employee is legally authorised to provide Employees with immigration advice without the relevant registration in line with the Immigration Act 2009. Immigration advice can only be obtained from Licensed Immigration Agencies and Immigration New Zealand.

## 5.9 Referral Bonus
The company recognises that often our best candidates come from those referred by our own and the Company offers a bonus for successful referrals. Employees involved in the recruitment and selection of a candidate are not eligible for a referral bonus; this includes members of the Senior Leadership Team given the identification and recruitment of new employees is considered part of the role as a leader of the company.

Conditions as follows:

- The referral program is valid for permanent positions only.

- The referred candidate must be a new hire (not an ex-employee or interviewed previously).

- To qualify, the referrer must be working at Brosnan on a permanent contract, and not working out a notice period.

Any exceptions to the above are to be approved by the CEO.

## 5.10 Relocation Support
The company may provide support to the employee with costs associated with relocation for work purposes. Payment to be generally made within the first month of employment for an external candidate, or when the move occurs for an internal relocation. Payment is made on the basis that if an employee is to terminate their employment within a predetermined timeframe, then repayment for such fees may occur. Details of the repayment conditions are included in the employee’s Individual Employment Agreement.

## 5.11 Recognition of Prior Service
Persons who are reappointed or re-engaged to work for the Company are able to apply for recognition of prior service.
