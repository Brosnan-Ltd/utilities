# Working Away

## 38.1 Purpose and Scope

This Working Away Policy sets the standards and guidelines for dealing with requirements to work and/or live away from the Employee’s primary location. By definition, this is a location that is too far from their home to travel each day. The policy is intended to support Employees and the Company to execute projects at remote sites or in another town or city.

## 38.2 Guiding Principles

38.2.1
: Each Project will be considered individually, as will the arrangements for each role within the project and the Employee’s unique situation.

38.2.2
: ‘Home’ location is the town or city of their primary residence and/or as noted in their employment agreement.

38.2.3
: ‘Away’ location is the town or city of the Company’s Project site.

38.2.4
: In all other instances, the Travel and Accommodation Policy will apply.

38.2.5
: For this policy, and the different roles required for Projects to be completed, roles are defined in two categories:
    - Construction Management – relates to work that is required for the duration of the Project and includes, but is not limited to, Construction Managers, Construction Supervisors, Project Managers, Site Managers, Site Supervisors and Quantity Surveyors. These roles are typically salaried.
    - Construction Delivery – relates to specific work that needs to be executed at certain times throughout a Project and includes, but is not limited to, Foremen, Leading Hands, Carpenters, and Hammerhands. These roles are typically hourly paid roles.
38.2.6
: All Employees are covered by the Group Employee Handbook, and this policy refers to several additional policies, in particular, Working Hours Policy, the Vehicle Policy and the Safe Driving Policy where additional information may be relevant/required.

38.2.7
: Working Away variation letters will be issued to employees confirming their individual arrangements where this policy applies. In addition, a copy of this policy will also be provided.

## 38.3 Options

### 38.3.1 Full Relocation

This section applies to projects with a minimum six-month duration.

Entails the full relocation of the Employee to the location of the project for the duration of the project – from their Home location to the Away location. Where applicable, this may include the Employee’s family in agreement with the relevant Regional Manager.

Where the Employee’s accommodation and utilities will be paid by the Company for the duration of the project a rental agreement between the employee and the Company will be put in place and signed by both parties. They company may provide the following:
- Furnished rental accommodation. The Company will sign the lease agreement on an annual basis (or the duration of the project if less than 12 months) Additionally, any spare rooms within the rental may be utilised by other Company employees working on the project. 
- Utilities – includes power, water, gas, and internet (fibre where available). The Company will arrange and pay all utilities, for reasonable use.
- All other expenses, including food and meals, will be borne by the Employee.
- All of the above will cease upon completion of the project.
- None of the above removes any rights or protections under the Residential Tenancy Act (1986) or other applicable legislation.

In some instances, it may be deemed more appropriate for the employee to receive a monthly payment to cover the rental accommodation and utilities. In this scenario the employee will be responsible for sourcing and securing their own rental accommodation in a suitable location in relation to the project. Whether this scenario is adopted will be at the discretion of the relevant Regional Manager. 

If the Employee’s family will also be relocating for the project duration, the Company will cover all fair and reasonable travel expenses related to one return trip for the family. The family’s relocation must be a minimum of six months, and the travel expenses will be payable at the start and finish of the project.

Relocation expenses, up to a maximum of $2,500 plus GST, may be available, on a reimbursement basis. To be reimbursed, the employee will need to provide detailed GST receipts for expenses such as shipping personal belongings. Reimbursements follow the guidelines outlined in the Expenses Policy. Reimbursement of relocation expenses will be based on:
- If the relocation is for less than six months, no relocation payment is applicable. 
- If the relocation is for six months to twelve months, one relocation payment is applicable, or two up to a maximum of $1,250 + GST for each.
- If the relocation is for twelve months or longer, the full relocation allowance (a maximum of $2,500) is available at both the start and end of a project.

### 38.3.2 Semi-permanent Relocation

This applies to Employees who are relocating on a semi-permanent basis.  This means that they would maintain their primary residence in their Home location while being temporarily assigned to work at an alternative location, for a specific project, outside of their accepted Home location. The temporary accommodation used  for the duration of their work on the project will be paid for by the Company, along with travel and food costs, and this includes:

- Temporary accommodation with a single occupied room, for example, a motel with kitchen/kitchenette facilities (where possible, the Company will seek to secure an ongoing arrangement for the duration of the project, and this may be a house – sharing situation).	
- Self-catered
- Project dependent additional benefit: every second weekend to be an extended four-day weekend, for     example, Friday to Monday or Thursday to Sunday, with weekly hours worked within the rest of the two weeks.
    - To facilitate the extended four-day weekends, the Company commits to an Employee’s contracted working hours, to be completed over a fortnight. This means that over a two week period, the employee will still work 80 hours if contracted to work 40 hours per week.
    -  Longer working days may be necessary to meet the contracted working hours within the guidelines set out in the Working Hours Policy.
- Travel time to be part of business hours, as much as practicable, for example, driving Tuesday morning after a long weekend.
- For salaried staff, if an Employee travels in their own hours, for example, the afternoon of the day before, the Employee’s manager has discretion concerning time off in lieu.
- For hourly paid Employees, travel time will be paid after the first hour of travel each way.
- We recommend Employees travel together wherever possible, particularly for long distances and remote areas, and to share the driving. The Safe Driving Policy will apply, in particular the clause Driving Hours.

If an employee’s work vehicle is at the ‘away’ location and it is impractical to drive the vehicle home, they may use the pool car if available. Travel and food allowances may be applicable. Please see the Travel and Accommodation Policy.

### 38.3.3 Travelling to and from the Site as Required

This will apply to Employees who need to regularly travel to the Project site which is outside of their Home location, and the guidelines in these instances include:
- Accommodation, travel, and food allowances as per the Travel and Accommodation Policy.
- Travel time to be part of business hours, as much as practicable, for example, driving Monday morning and back Friday afternoon.
- For salaried staff, if an Employee travels in their own hours, for example, Sunday afternoon, the Employee’s manager has discretion concerning time off in lieu.
- For hourly paid Employees, travel time will be paid after the first hour of travel each way.
- We recommend Employees travel together wherever possible, particularly for long distances and remote areas, and to share the driving. In these instances,tThe Safe Driving Policy will apply, in particular the clause regarding,  Driving Hours.

## 38.4 Travel

### 38.4.1 Travel Costs

It is preferred that a Company vehicle be used for all business-related travel, hence all Company vehicles are available for Company use including, where applicable, allocated and pool vehicles.

In the instances where Employees cannot use a Company vehicle or pool car, the Company’s Vehicle Policy’s Claiming Mileage – use of a personal vehicle section applies.

If a Company vehicle or pool car is available or provided for use, and an employee chooses to use their own vehicle, the Employee is not eligible to claim mileage or costs. If the Employee is considering using a personal vehicle, they should discuss it first with their manager or Regional Manager before travelling.

### 38.4.2 Travel Time Paid

For hourly paid Employees, where the Company provides transport to, or from, a Project site that is covered by this policy as an Away location, the Company will pay the Employee for the time taken to travel after the first hour of travel each way.
