# Code of Conduct

## 2.1	Purpose and Scope
To protect your well-being and the well-being of others, we have developed a Code of Conduct setting out behaviour standards that all Employees are required to follow. You need to be aware of these standards as you commence your employment.

The Code also applies to any consultants or contractors and will form part of those contractual agreements to the extent specified in the contract arrangements to the extent specified in the contract between that person / company and Brosnan.

The Code of Conduct is not necessarily exhaustive, and the Company reserves the right to alter or amend these standards. Please read the Code carefully and discuss this with your manager if you have any questions or if anything is unclear.

## 2.2	The Company’s Expectations of Employees
In the course of performing duties associated with your role, you will need to work alongside your direct team and other staff. Developing good internal relationships is an important part of business operations, and any disagreements are to be handled professionally, with respect and dignity to one another, co-workers, and clients.

All staff are representatives of the Company, and you are expected to perform your duties in such a way that reflects positively on both the Company and other individuals involved in the business. You are expected to show a responsible attitude and behave reasonably.

**All Employees are expected to:**
- Use their best endeavours to promote and protect the interests and reputation of the Company.
- Exercise expected standards of professionalism and performance.
- Ensure professional and personal activities do not contravene the interests of the Company.
- Maintain high standards of honesty, integrity, ethics, fidelity, loyalty, and confidentiality.
- Demonstrate courtesy and respect for colleagues and customers, including respect for cultural diversity.
- Comply with all laws, reasonable instructions, and Company policies and procedures.
- Ensure information or property of the Company is not used for Employee’s own benefit or that of any other third party.
- Be available to attend duties as reasonably required, and promptly advise of necessary absences.
- Maintain appropriate standards of behaviour and attire.
- Maintain standards of security of equipment, buildings, and information.
- Continue to respect the confidentiality and other aspects of this Code after ceasing employment with the Company.

## 2.3	Office/Site Maintenance
All Company Employees are responsible for ensuring a clean and tidy office/site. This includes individual workspace, meeting rooms, lunchrooms, bathrooms, and the kitchen.

All Company Employees should consider their behaviour when wearing company-branded clothing out of the office or away from the worksite.

## 2.4	Visitors
All visitors are to be treated with respect and attention so that whatever the outcome, it can be accomplished in an atmosphere that will give a favourable impression of the Company. Requests for information, materials and donations should be directed to the relevant Employees helpfully and professionally, ensuring that no breach of commercial interest occurs.

Visitors are to be met in a meeting room, where possible. Visitors must not be allowed to wander the office or site without being accompanied by an Employee.

## 2.5	Telephone
We expect that every staff member exercise telephone courtesy whether using a desk phone or mobile phone. When you are unavailable, either divert your phone to the appropriate person or use the voicemail facility. If you are on leave, then your voicemail message should reflect this and indicate your date of return and an alternative contact.

## 2.6	Building/Site Security
It is the Employee’s responsibility to ensure that the Security Alarm, where fitted, is turned on whenever premises are left unattended.

Alarm codes, where known, must be kept confidential, not shared, and must be changed upon staff leaving or changing locations. When leaving, ensure buildings/sites are secured.

All Employees who have possession of keys to Company/Site property are responsible for their safety. You should report the loss of keys immediately to your manager.

## 2.7	Usage of Stock or Equipment
Employees are not permitted to borrow stock or equipment for your own or someone else's private use, of any type and for any reason, without authorisation from your manager.

The above applies regardless of the intention to return the stock or equipment.

## 2.8	Differences of Opinion
Employees are at all times expected to behave in a respectful and courteous manner. We at Brosnan encourage the challenging of the status quo; however, this needs to be done in a professional manner.

Challenging or sharing opposing views does not mean that employees can disregard or fail to follow all reasonable instructions from Managers.

## 2.9	Accountability and Reporting
At Brosnan, we take responsibility for our actions and those around us. All employees are expected to report any form of unacceptable behaviour from coworkers, leaders, or contractors to their direct manager.

As a Leader or Manager, you are expected to take appropriate action when you are made aware of inappropriate behaviour on-site or in the office. This could include giving feedback, Corrective Action forms or formal disciplinary action.

## 2.10	Cartel Conduct
All employees are prohibited from entering into a contract or arrangement or arriving at an understanding containing a cartel provision. A cartel provision is any provision in an agreement between competitors that has the purpose, effect, or likely effect of fixing prices, restricting output, or allocating markets.

If an Employee becomes aware of any cartel conduct, they are required to promptly disclose this to their Manager. However, if the allegation is against the Manager, then the Employee should speak to the CEO  or Director, any allegation concerning a Director should be made to another Director. Refer also to the Whistle-blower and Disclosure Policy.
