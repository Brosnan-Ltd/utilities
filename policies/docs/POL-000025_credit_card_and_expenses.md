- Cards remain the property of Brosnan at all times.

- Include original GST receipts/invoices (no bank statements or credit card slips alone)  
- Be fully completed on the standard Expense Claim form  
- Be approved by the cardholder’s manager (and a director if over $500)

## 26.7 Receipt and Reconciliation Requirements  
- Every transaction must have a detailed receipt showing GST  
- Cardholders must submit a monthly reconciliation with all receipts attached  
- Reconciliation must be completed and submitted within 7 days of the statement date  
- Any missing receipts or unexplained items will be deducted from the employee’s next pay

## 26.8 Spending Limits  
- Individual transaction limits and monthly credit limits are set at card issuance  
- Any request to exceed limits requires prior written approval from a director

## 26.9 Personal Use or Misuse  
- Any personal expenditure identified will be repaid immediately by the cardholder  
- Failure to repay or repeated misuse will result in:  
  - Immediate cancellation of the card  
  - Disciplinary action up to and including termination  
  - Possible legal action for fraud

## 26.10 Lost or Stolen Cards  
Must be reported to the bank and the Finance Manager immediately (within 1 hour).

## 26.11 Card Return  
Cards must be returned immediately upon:

Final pay may be withheld until the card is returned and all outstanding amounts reconciled.
