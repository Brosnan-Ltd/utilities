# Leave

## 4.1 Purpose and Scope
The various types of leave covered in this policy are an entitlement of all permanent full-time and part-time employees. All leave entitlements have been documented to ensure that practices meet the requirements of the Holidays Act 2003 and other applicable NZ legislation.

Any Employee who is unsure of their entitlement should contact their manager or the HR Team for clarification.

All Employees are expected to conduct a handover with their supervisor and/or co-workers and to set up an out-of-office message on their work mobile and email where applicable.

## 4.2 Annual Leave

### 4.2.1 Entitlements
The Holidays Act 2003 provides each Employee with an entitlement to not less than four weeks of paid annual leave after the end of each completed 12 months of continuous employment.

Annual Leave Accrual – Annual Leave is accrued during each 12 months of continuous employment, but the employer may allow the accrued leave to be taken in advance of the entitlement and utilised during the 12 months of employment during which it is accrued. The Company makes this provision and encourages employees to use their accrued leave.

Annual Leave Entitlement – After the end of each completed 12 months of service, on the employee’s anniversary date, Annual Leave accruals become an entitlement. Employees should note that on our Payroll system and payslips, Annual Leave Entitlement is noted as Outstanding Leave.

### 4.2.2 Requesting Annual Leave
Annual leave can be requested by filling in the appropriate Leave Application form and submitting it to the relevant Manager.

It is the Company’s policy that employees may utilise Annual Leave that they have accrued for their leave, and any shortfall will need to be taken as unpaid leave. Employees are expected to give at least 1 months’ notice to their manager of the date they would like to take annual leave. If the Company can accommodate the request, then leave will be granted.

The Company may require the employee to take annual leave when the parties are unable to reach an agreement on when the Employee’s annual leave should be taken. The Company will give the Employee 1 months’ notice if the employee is required to take annual leave.

### 4.2.3 Refusal of Requests for Annual Leave
The Company is entitled to consider the operational requirements of the workplace in deciding whether to authorise annual leave. Sometimes this may mean that leave is declined or in other cases that leave is cancelled; neither will be done without consultation.

### 4.2.4 Cashing Up Annual Leave
Annual leave becomes an entitlement when the leave accrued is over 12 months old.

Employees can request, in writing, a pay-out in cash, for up to one week of their entitlement. This can be done in one or more requests per annum up to a maximum of one week.

The requests will be considered in good faith within a reasonable time, but they may be declined. The Employee will be advised of the decision in writing and where applicable, payment will be made on the next payday.

## 4.3 Sick Leave

### 4.3.1 Entitlements
Employees are entitled to ten days of paid Sick Leave after the first six months of continuous employment and on the anniversary of this date each year thereafter if they have worked for the Company for:

- at least an average of ten (10) hours a week during that period; and
- not less than one (1) hour in every week during that period or no less than forty (40) hours in every month during that period.

They shall be entitled to ten (10) days of Sick Leave in each ensuing period of twelve (12) months.

Sick Leave can be used when an employee is sick or injured, or when the Employee’s spouse or partner or a person who depends on the Employee for care (such as a child or elderly parent) is sick or injured and requires care.

Unused Sick Leave may be accumulated to a maximum of 20 days. Accumulated Sick Leave cannot be exchanged for cash, or form part of any final payment to the Employee on resignation or termination.

### 4.3.2 Proof of illness
The Company has the right, where the Employee is sick or injured, to require the Employee to provide proof, such as a certificate from a Health Practitioner, of the injury or illness within 3 days. The Company may provide the name of a Health Practitioner to obtain the certificate. The Company agrees to meet the Employee's reasonable expenses in obtaining a certificate.

Where the Employee is using sick leave to care for another person, such as a spouse or child, the Manager can similarly require proof of sickness for that person as above.

### 4.3.3 Health Certificate
The Company has the right to accept or reject a certificate from a Health Practitioner if it does not meet the Medical Council of NZ Standards.

## 4.4 Bereavement Leave

### 4.4.1 Entitlements
Following six months of continuous employment and on the anniversary of this date each year thereafter, the Employee shall be entitled to up to 3 days' paid leave for immediate family members. This can be taken at any time and for any purpose genuinely relating to the death. This also includes instances of miscarriage or stillbirth.

“Immediate family members” are the Employee's spouse/partner, parent, child, spouse’s child, sibling, grandparent, grandchild, or the spouse/partner's parents. Where there are multiple bereavements, the Employee is entitled to three days' Bereavement Leave in respect of each death.

In the event of death outside the immediate family that causes a person to suffer a bereavement, up to 1 day of paid leave may be taken if the Company accepts that the Employee has suffered a bereavement.

## 4.5 Parental Leave
Parental Leave provides the opportunity for Employees to devote time to their child or children during the first year of their parenting relationship without disadvantaging those Employees and their careers.

### 4.5.1 Leave Eligibility
To check out eligibility and entitlements go to: https://www.employment.govt.nz/leave-and-holidays/parental-leave

Notice of Intention:  
Notice of intention to take parental leave must be made in writing by the Employee. The Company should receive this at least three months before the expected date of delivery, though the Company may agree to less notice. A certificate, or a copy of a certificate, from the doctor or midwife, stating when the baby is due must be attached to the letter.

### 4.5.2 Partners Leave
Where Employees are entitled to Partners Leave, the Company will allow Employees to take available annual leave and/or sick leave (5 days or less) for Partner Leave.

## 4.6 Family Violence Leave
Following six months of continuous employment and on the anniversary of this date each year thereafter, the Employee shall be entitled to Family Violence Leave. Applications for Family Violence Leave must be made in writing. The Company will abide by the Family Violence Act 2018.

## 4.7 Informing the Company when Absent
Employees are required to inform their manager at the earliest opportunity of the intention to be absent (sick or otherwise) – where possible before they are due to start work, otherwise as early as possible. The Employee must call and speak to their manager before their normal starting time.

If the manager is not available on their mobile number, leave a comprehensive message stating why you cannot attend work and a number that you will be contactable on. Keep in regular contact with your manager, informing them of any developments.

### 4.7.1 What NOT to do if you are absent

- Leave a voice message and remain un-contactable.
- Leave a voice message without a reason and a return-to-work expectation time.
- Send a text or email notification.
- Ask a friend or family member to call on your behalf (unless you cannot do this for yourself, e.g.: you have had an accident and are in the hospital).
- Call another Employee and ask them to pass on a message.
- Call Reception and ask for a message to be passed on.

Any “unexplained absences” will not be paid, and “leave without pay” will apply, annual leave will not be paid. “Unexplained” means that you did not contact your manager on the day of your absence. “Unexplained absences” are considered serious misconduct and disciplinary action may follow.

## 4.8 Public Holiday
Employees must get pre-approval to work on a public holiday. Any unapproved work on a public holiday, will not be paid.

## 4.9 Health Incapacity
We recognise that any health incapacity is difficult; however, where an Employee becomes incapable of performing any duties because of mental or physical illness or incapacity, the Company may terminate their employment by giving notice as set out in the Employment Agreement. To assist the Company in deciding whether to take this action, the Company may require the employee to undergo an examination by a registered Health Practitioner for proof of illness. The Company will meet the costs of this.

The Company will receive reports and/or assessments from this health practitioner along with other relevant information that you may wish to provide. In the absence of such information or should you refuse to undergo an examination; the Company reserves the right to then make an assessment and decision regarding possible termination of employment on the information known to the Company at the time.

## 4.10 Notice / Termination /Abandonment of Employment
If the employee decides to leave the Company, the Employee must give at least the minimum notice in writing as specified in their Employment Agreement. If the Employee terminates their contract without the required period of notice, the Employee will forfeit from their wages the unworked part of the notice period.

If the employee is absent from work for more than three consecutive days without notifying their manager, they will be deemed to have terminated their employment agreement with the Company by way of Abandonment of Employment, unless it subsequently is proved that they were unable, through no fault of their own, to inform the Company. The Company will make every effort to contact the Employee before termination.

All property e.g., Company vehicle, keys, documents, equipment, or any other items belonging to the Company which were issued to the Employee during their term of employment, must be returned to their manager before departure on the last day of employment. Unreturned Company Property will be deducted from final pay.

## 4.11 Leave Without Pay

### 4.11.1 Application
Applications for leave without pay (LWOP) for periods should be discussed with your manager and will be subject to management approval.

Except in extraordinary and justifiable circumstances, LWOP may not be granted:

- where an Employee has an entitlement to accrued Annual Leave; or
- where work commitments cannot be met because of the proposed additional leave.

### 4.11.2 Extended Leave Without Pay
Where an Employee applies for extended LWOP (more than one month) for overseas travel or educational purposes, for example, this will be subject to management approval.

An application for extended LWOP will need to be supported by the direct Manager before the Chief Operating Officer will consider approval. Such approval may be subject to the Company’s special conditions concerning job availability upon return, this will be agreed upon in advance of any approval.

When LWOP is granted, in most cases continuity of service will be retained, but the period of leave will not count towards Company service.

Annual Leave and other service-related benefits shall all be suspended during periods of LWOP.

### 4.11.3 Requirement to Take Annual Leave During Closedown Period
The Company typically closes our offices and sites over the Christmas/New Year period with a formal closedown period requiring employees to take annual holidays at this time. As required by legislation, the Company will provide employees with not less than 14 days’ notice in advance of a formal closedown period.

An employee who is entitled to annual leave at the commencement of a closedown period must, if required to do so by the Company, take annual leave during the closedown period.

Existing employees (not a recent joiner):

- If an employee does not have enough accrued annual leave for the closedown period, the employee will need to take unpaid leave. However, in the case where an employee is short one or two days, the Company may grant annual leave in advance. A request for the exception must be approved by both the employee’s manager and the CEO.

New employees (employed within the two months before a closedown period):

- An employee who is not yet entitled to annual leave, at the commencement of a closedown period must, if required to do so by the Company, stop work during a closedown period. If this section applies, the Company must give the Employee not less than 14 days’ notice of the requirement to take the annual leave or to discontinue the work (as the case may be).
- If the new employee does not have enough accrued leave to utilize for the closedown period, the Company agrees to advance annual leave as required for the period.

Long service leave must generally be taken in one lump period unless exceptional circumstances exist, and the CEO approves a different arrangement.

If you have eligibility for long service leave but have not taken it, the leave will not be paid out upon resignation, retirement, or redundancy.

However, any juror’s fees are to be paid to the Company unless the Employee requests to take the leave as annual leave or leave without pay and the Company agrees to allow such leave.

Employees who have an employment term of fewer than six months will be required to take leave without pay to attend jury service. They will then retain all expenses and juror’s fees paid to them.
