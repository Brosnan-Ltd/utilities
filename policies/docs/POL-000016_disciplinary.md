   - The employee will receive written notice of the meeting (at least 24–48 hours where practicable) detailing the concerns  
   - The employee may bring a support person or representative  
   - The employee will be given a full opportunity to respond  
   - The meeting will be documented

## 17.9 Abandonment of Employment
If an employee is absent without notification or approval for 3 or more consecutive working days, they may be treated as having abandoned their employment. Termination will follow after reasonable attempts to contact them.
