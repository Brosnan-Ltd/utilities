# Fitness For Work

We are committed to making a positive difference, and this applies to risk factors that may affect a person’s fitness for work. The major risk factors include, but are not limited to:

- Deficits in safe functional capacity for work (either physical or psychological)
- Use of alcohol and/or other drugs (including medications)
- Fatigue

People whose fitness for work may be impaired by deficits in safe functional capacity for work, alcohol and/or other drugs, or fatigue, pose a risk to themselves and other workers. We have undertaken to manage and minimise these risk factors to provide a safe, healthy and productive working environment.

Workers who do not produce a negative test result, or in circumstances management have reasonable cause to suspect a worker’s fitness for work is inhibited, a worker may be stood down pending the outcome of an investigation.

We will:

- Provide a safe working environment by eliminating and minimising the hazards associated with the inappropriate use of alcohol and drugs.
- Provide a safe working environment by eliminating and minimising the hazards associated with fatigue within the work environment.
- Provide employee assistance and measures to overcome alcohol and other drug problems as well as fatigue that could impair a person’s fitness for work.
- Ensure workers are informed of the risks associated with fatigue and how to participate in controlling the risks.

Management is responsible for:

- Implementing this policy in their respective areas of responsibility.
- Standing down employees for whom they hold a reasonable suspicion their fitness for work is inhibited.
- Monitoring employee condition and ensuring employees are fit for work.

Workers are responsible for:

- Reporting any injury, illness, or condition which may impair their capacity for work.
- Ensuring their lifestyle choices outside working hours do not impact their ability to carry out their duties or cause a risk to their own or to other workers’ safety and health.
- Ensuring they get adequate rest and are not in a fatigued state before commencing work.
- Advising their Manager or Supervisor of any known psychological factors / mental stressors.
- Advising their Manager or Supervisor if they consider themselves or others to be unfit to work safely.
