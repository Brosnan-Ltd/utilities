# Tools

## 21.1 Purpose
To ensure all company-provided tools and equipment are used safely, maintained properly, and accounted for, while minimising loss, theft, or damage.

## 21.2 Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and subcontractors who are issued or use Brosnan-owned tools, power tools, plant, or equipment.

## 21.3 Issuing of Tools
- Tools are issued on a sign-out basis via the site foreman, leading hand, or office administrator.
- Employees must sign for every tool or kit issued to them (paper or electronic tool register).
- A tool allowance or tool replacement contribution may form part of certain employment agreements (refer to your individual employment agreement).

## 21.4 Employee Responsibilities
Every person issued tools must:
- Use tools only for work-related purposes
- Inspect tools daily and report any damage or faults immediately
- Keep tools clean and in good working order
- Store tools securely when not in use (locked toolboxes, site containers, or vehicles)
- Never leave tools unattended on site or in an unsecured vehicle
- Return all tools in the same condition they were issued (fair wear and tear accepted)
- Report lost, stolen, or damaged tools to their supervisor immediately

## 21.5 Care and Maintenance
- All power tools must have a current electrical test tag
- Damaged or faulty tools must be tagged “Out of Service” and reported
- Employees must follow manufacturer instructions and safe operating procedures
- Sharpening, servicing, or repairs are to be arranged through the site foreman or office

## 21.6 Loss, Theft, or Negligent Damage
- Employees may be required to pay the replacement cost (or a portion thereof) if a tool is lost, stolen, or damaged due to negligence or failure to follow this policy.
- Repeated loss or careless damage will be treated as misconduct and may lead to disciplinary action.

## 21.7 Personal Tools on Site
- Employees may use their own tools only with prior approval from their supervisor.
- Brosnan accepts no responsibility for loss, theft, or damage to personal tools.
- Personal tools must meet the same safety and testing standards as company tools.

## 21.8 End of Employment or Project
- All company tools must be returned on or before the last day of work.
- Final pay may be withheld until all tools are accounted for and returned in acceptable condition.

## 21.9 Tool Audits

Any questions about tools or this policy should be directed to your site foreman or manager.
